## ⚡ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Execution Flow

**Action Steps:**
**The command delegates to `/execute` for intelligent orchestration of components:**

```markdown
/execute Perform enhanced consensus + comprehensive review:
1. /consensus [target]               # Fast consensus building (2-5 minutes)
                                     - Multi-agent agreement using 4 parallel agents
                                     - Quick architectural and correctness validation
                                     - Early identification of critical issues
                                     - 3-round maximum with early termination
2. /guidelines                       # Centralized mistake prevention consultation
3. Evaluate consensus result:
   - If **CONSENSUS_REWORK**: Summarize blockers, halt here, and request fixes before deep review.
   - If **MIXED_SIGNALS**: Proceed to Stage 2 with targeted focus areas provided by consensus agents.
   - If **CONSENSUS_PASS**: Proceed to full Stage 2 execution.
4. When Stage 2 runs, launch PARALLEL EXECUTION:
   Track A (Technical - Fast):    /cerebras comprehensive technical analysis [target] (SOLO DEV FOCUS)
                                  - Security vulnerability scanning (real vulnerabilities only)
                                  - Trusted source detection (GitHub API, package managers)
                                  - Functional bugs and performance issues
                                  - Architecture pattern analysis
                                  - Performance bottleneck identification
                                  - Filter out enterprise paranoia (JSON schema validation for trusted APIs)
   Track B (Technical - Deep):    /arch [target] + Independent code-review subagent synthesis + gemini-consultant + cursor-consultant + codex-consultant + code-centralization-consultant
                                  - System design and scalability analysis
                                  - Integration patterns and dependencies
                                  - Code quality and maintainability assessment
                                  - Comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis (Gemini CLI consultation)
                                  - Unconventional insights and contrarian analysis (Cursor consultation)
                                  - Multi-stage deep code analysis (Codex CLI consultation)
                                  - Consolidation and duplication remediation roadmap (Code Centralization consultation)
   Track C (AI Research):         Perplexity MCP comprehensive review [target] (gpt-5 model)
                                  - OWASP security standards and latest vulnerability research
                                  - Industry best practices and proven approaches
                                  - Performance optimization and benchmarking insights
                                  - Emerging security patterns and prevention techniques
                                  - Real-world code review expertise from security communities
5. Confidence scoring & false-positive filtering (from official claude-plugins-official/code-review):
   - For each issue found across Tracks A, B, C: launch parallel Haiku agents to score 0-100 confidence
   - Rubric (give verbatim to each scoring agent):
     * 0: False positive, doesn't stand up to light scrutiny, or pre-existing issue
     * 25: Might be real but unverified; stylistic issues not explicitly in CLAUDE.md
     * 50: Verified real issue but minor or infrequent in practice
     * 75: Double-checked, very likely real, directly impacts functionality or explicitly in CLAUDE.md
     * 100: Confirmed real, happens frequently, evidence directly confirms it
   - Filter out ALL issues with score < 80. If no issues remain, note "No high-confidence issues found" and skip posting
   - For CLAUDE.md-flagged issues: scoring agent MUST verify CLAUDE.md actually calls out that specific issue
   - False positives to filter: pre-existing issues, nitpicks a senior engineer would ignore, linter/type-checker catches, general quality issues unless in CLAUDE.md, issues on unmodified lines **except when a clear causal link from modified code to the unchanged code path exists** (in that case: the reviewer must (1) explain the causal link and reference the modifying symbol(s), (2) provide minimal repro steps or stack trace showing the regression, and (3) mark the issue as "exception" so it surfaces despite the unmodified-line filter)
6. /reviewe [target]                 # Enhanced code review with security analysis
7. Synthesis & PR guidelines         # Combine consensus + all three tracks + generate docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/guidelines.md
```

The `/execute` delegation ensures optimal execution with:
8. **Always-Parallel Review Tracks**: Default simultaneous execution of technical (/cerebras), architectural (/arch), and AI research (Perplexity) analysis for significant speed improvement
9. **Guidelines Generation**: Automatically creates `docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/guidelines.md` with PR-specific mistake prevention patterns
10. **Guidelines Integration**: Consults existing `docs/pr-guidelines/base-guidelines.md` (general patterns) and generates PR-specific guidelines
11. **Anti-Pattern Application**: Analyzes review findings to document new mistake patterns and solutions
12. **Intelligent Synthesis**: Combines technical and strategic findings into comprehensive recommendations
13. Progress tracking via TodoWrite
14. Auto-approval for review workflows
15. Optimized parallel execution for maximum speed

Each command is executed with the same target parameter passed to `/reviewdeep`.

## 🛡️ Solo Developer Security Focus

### **Trusted Source Detection & Context-Aware Analysis**

The `/reviewdeep` command now implements intelligent context detection to distinguish between trusted and untrusted data sources, providing security analysis appropriate for solo developers:

### **Trusted Sources (Reduced Enterprise Paranoia)**

- **GitHub API responses** - Skip JSON schema validation for official GitHub API endpoints
- **Package managers** - npm, PyPI, Maven, NuGet from official registries
- **CDN providers** - cdnjs, unpkg, jsdelivr, and other established CDNs
- **Official documentation** - Framework docs, language specifications
- **Verified open source** - Projects with good reputation and security track record

### **Untrusted Sources (Full Security Analysis)**

- **User input** - Web forms, file uploads, command line arguments
- **External APIs** - Third-party services without verification
- **Dynamic code** - eval(), exec(), and code generation
- **File system access** - User-controlled paths and file operations
- **Database queries** - Dynamic SQL with user input

### **Security Focus Areas (Solo Developer Priorities)**

#### ✅ **ALWAYS ANALYZED** - Real Security Vulnerabilities

1. **Command Injection** - Unsanitized user input in system commands, shell=True risks
2. **Credential Exposure** - Hardcoded secrets, API keys in code, .env file issues
3. **Path Traversal** - User-controlled file paths, directory traversal vulnerabilities
4. **SQL Injection** - Dynamic queries without parameterization
5. **XSS Vulnerabilities** - Unsanitized output in web applications
6. **Authentication Flaws** - Session handling, password storage issues
7. **CSRF Vulnerabilities** - Missing CSRF tokens in state-changing operations

#### ❌ **FILTERED OUT** - Enterprise Paranoia (For Trusted Sources Only)

1. **JSON Schema Validation** - For trusted APIs like GitHub, npm registry
2. **Excessive Input Validation** - For verified package responses
3. **Theoretical Attack Vectors** - Low-probability scenarios with negligible real-world risk
4. **Complex Retry Patterns** - Over-engineered error handling for simple use cases
5. **Enterprise Compliance** - SOX, HIPAA, PCI-DSS unless specifically requested
6. **Over-Architected Security** - Complex patterns for simple solo developer needs

### **Context Detection Logic**

```markdown
IF data_source IN trusted_sources:
    SKIP enterprise_paranoia_checks
    FOCUS ON implementation_vulnerabilities
    VALIDATE integration_points_only
ELSE:
    APPLY full_security_analysis
    REPORT all_vulnerability_categories
    PROVIDE detailed_risk_assessment
END
```

### **Solo Developer Configuration**

**Default Behavior**: `--solo-dev-focus` (automatically applied)
- Practical security analysis for solo developers
- Trusted source detection enabled
- Enterprise paranoia filtering active

**Override Options**:
- `--enterprise-mode` - Full enterprise-level analysis (disables filtering)
- `--trust-level [strict|moderate|lenient]` - Adjust trusted source thresholds
- `--include-theoretical` - Include low-probability theoretical risks

## What You Get

### Comprehensive Coverage (Speed Optimized)

- **Technical Fast Track**: Security analysis, architecture patterns, performance optimization (/cerebras speed)
- **Technical Deep Track**: System design, scalability analysis, code quality assessment (Claude synthesis)
- **Combined Analysis**: Merged technical findings with prioritized technical recommendations

## Implementation Protocol

**When `/reviewdeep` is invoked, it delegates to `/execute` for orchestration:**

```markdown
/execute Perform enhanced parallel review with comprehensive multi-perspective analysis:

Step 1: Execute guidelines consultation
/guidelines

Step 2: PARALLEL EXECUTION (Speed Optimized):
Track A (Technical - Fast): /cerebras comprehensive technical analysis [target]
  - Solo developer functional issue assessment
  - Architecture pattern evaluation
  - Performance bottleneck analysis
Track B (Technical - Deep): /arch [target] + Independent code-review subagent
  - System design and scalability analysis
  - Technical integration patterns
  - Code quality and maintainability recommendations

Step 3: Execute enhanced review and post comments
/reviewe [target]

Step 4: Synthesize parallel findings
Combine fast and deep technical analysis into prioritized technical recommendations

Step 5: Generate PR-specific guidelines from combined findings
Create docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/guidelines.md with documented patterns and solutions
```

**The `/execute` delegation provides**:
- Automatic workflow planning and optimization
- Built-in progress tracking with TodoWrite
- Intelligent parallelization where applicable
- Resource-efficient execution

**Important**: Each command must be executed with the same target parameter. If no target is provided, all commands operate on the current branch/PR.

## Examples

```bash

# Review current branch/PR with solo developer security focus (most common usage)

/reviewdeep

# This executes: /guidelines → PARALLEL(/cerebras technical + /arch deep) → /reviewe → synthesis + SOLO DEV FILTERING

/reviewd

# Review a specific PR with solo developer context detection

/reviewdeep 592

# Automatically detects trusted sources (GitHub API calls) and filters enterprise paranoia

/reviewd #592

# Review a file with context-aware security analysis

/reviewdeep ".claude/commands/pr.py"

# Analyzes real vulnerabilities, skips theoretical concerns for solo developers

/reviewd "GitHub integration feature"

# Override for enterprise-level analysis (when needed)

/reviewdeep --enterprise-mode "security-critical-feature"

# Disables trusted source filtering, applies full enterprise security checks

```

## When to Use

- **Major architectural changes** - Need both code and design analysis (with solo developer focus)
- **High-risk implementations** - Require thorough multi-angle examination (real vulnerabilities only)
- **Performance-critical code** - Need technical + strategic assessment
- **Security-sensitive features** - Practical vulnerability analysis (filters enterprise paranoia)
- **Complex integrations** - Architectural + implementation concerns (trusted source detection)
- **Before production deployment** - Complete readiness evaluation (solo developer appropriate)
- **GitHub API integrations** - Automatically applies trusted source context
- **Package dependency reviews** - Focuses on real security issues, not theoretical concerns

## Comparison with Individual Commands

- **`/review`**: Official built-in code review (basic)
- **`/reviewe`**: Enhanced review (official + advanced analysis)
- **`/arch`**: Architectural assessment only
- **`/cerebras`**: Fast technical analysis (security, architecture, performance)
- **`/reviewdeep`**: Parallel execution of technical + strategic tracks for comprehensive analysis with significant speed improvement + SOLO DEVELOPER SECURITY FOCUS (filters enterprise paranoia)

## 🔄 **MANDATORY Agent Output Synthesis Protocol**

When `/reviewdeep` completes parallel execution, the final synthesis MUST include:

### **External AI Consultation Integration**

```

This ensures that the valuable insights from external AI models are captured, synthesized, and presented as part of the comprehensive review output.
- **Efficient**: Always leverages /cerebras's speed for technical analysis while maintaining independent code-review subagent's objective insights
- **Flexible**: Individual commands can still be used separately when full analysis isn't needed, enterprise mode available when needed
- **Maintainable**: Parallel execution improves performance without breaking existing functionality
- **AI-Enhanced**: Mandatory MCP integration provides expert-level analysis beyond traditional code review
- **Optimal Resource Usage**: Maximizes AI capabilities through parallel processing while reducing noise

## Review Principles & Philosophy

### Core Principles (Applied During Analysis) - Solo Developer Focus

- **Verify Before Modify**: Ensure bugs are reproduced and root causes understood before suggesting fixes
- **Incremental and Isolated Changes**: Recommend small, atomic modifications that can be tested independently
- **Test-Driven Resolution**: Suggest writing tests for bug scenarios before implementing fixes
- **Practical Security**: Focus on real vulnerabilities (command injection, credential exposure) over theoretical concerns
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Distinguish trusted sources (GitHub API, npm registry) from untrusted user input
- **Solo Developer Appropriate**: Filter enterprise paranoia, focus on exploitable vulnerabilities
- **Defensive Validation**: Recommend input checks for untrusted sources, skip excessive validation for trusted APIs
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud**: No silent fallbacks - errors should be explicit and actionable

### Development Tenets (Beliefs That Guide Reviews) - Solo Developer Context

- **Bugs Are Opportunities**: Each issue is a chance to enhance robustness, not just patch symptoms
- **Prevention Over Cure**: Prioritize practices that avoid bugs (code reuse, proper abstractions)
- **Simplicity Wins**: Simpler code is less error-prone - avoid over-engineering and enterprise paranoia
- **Practical Security First**: Real vulnerabilities matter more than theoretical compliance concerns
- **Trust Context Matters**: GitHub API responses don't need JSON schema validation, user input does need sanitization
- **CI Parity Is Sacred**: All code must run deterministically in CI vs local environments
- **Solo Developer Realism**: Balance security with development velocity appropriate for solo/small teams
- **Continuous Learning**: Document patterns from failures to prevent recurrence

### Quality Goals (What Reviews Aim For)

- **Zero Regressions**: Ensure changes don't introduce new bugs
- **High Code Coverage**: Recommend 80-90% test coverage for critical paths
- **Maintainable Codebase**: Fixes should improve readability and modularity
- **Fast MTTR**: Issues should be resolvable within hours with proper documentation
- **Reduced Bug Density**: Lower bugs per 1000 lines through preventive patterns

### 6. **Testing & CI Safety Analysis** (Enhanced from /reviewe)

Building on the code-level checks from `/reviewe`, this phase analyzes system-wide patterns:

- **Subprocess Discipline at Scale**: System-wide timeout enforcement patterns
- **Skip Pattern Elimination**: Zero tolerance policy enforcement across entire codebase
- **CI Parity Validation**: Test infrastructure consistency analysis
- **Resource Management Patterns**: System-level cleanup strategies
- **Input Sanitization Architecture**: Security patterns across all entry points
- **Error Handling Philosophy**: Consistent error propagation strategies

## 🚨 CRITICAL: PR Guidelines Generation Protocol

### **Automatic Guidelines Creation**

`/reviewdeep` automatically generates PR-specific guidelines based on review findings:

**PR Context Detection**:
- **Primary**: Auto-detect PR number from current branch context via GitHub API
- **Fallback 1**: Extract from branch name patterns (e.g., `pr-1286-feature`, `fix-1286-bug`)
- **Fallback 2**: If no PR context, create branch-specific guidelines in `docs/branch-guidelines/{BRANCH_NAME}/guidelines.md`
- **Fallback 3**: If outside any PR/branch context (e.g., file/feature targets), skip guidelines generation and continue with analysis only
- **Manual Override**: Accept explicit PR number via `/reviewdeep --pr 1286`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Never fail /reviewdeep execution due to guidelines generation issues - log warning and proceed

**File Location**:
- **With PR**: `docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/guidelines.md` (e.g., `docs/pr-guidelines/1286/guidelines.md`)
- **Without PR**: `docs/branch-guidelines/{BRANCH_NAME}/guidelines.md` (e.g., `docs/branch-guidelines/feature-auth/guidelines.md`)

**Generation Process**:
1. **Analyze Review Findings**: Extract patterns from `/reviewe`, `/arch`, and `/thinku` analysis
2. **Identify Mistake Patterns**: Document specific issues found in the PR
3. **Create Solutions**: Provide ❌ wrong vs ✅ correct examples with code snippets
4. **Generate Anti-Patterns**: Structure findings as reusable anti-patterns for future prevention
5. **Document Context**: Include PR-specific context and historical references

### **Guidelines Content Structure**

Generated guidelines file includes:

```markdown

# PR #{PR_NUMBER} Guidelines - {PR_TITLE}

## 🎯 PR-Specific Principles

- Core principles discovered from this PR's analysis

## 🚫 PR-Specific Anti-Patterns

- **Perplexity MCP**: ALWAYS required for research-based security and best practice insights
- **No Fallback Mode**: All MCP integrations are mandatory, not optional
- **Error Handling**: Proper timeout and retry logic for MCP calls
- **Expert Integration**: Context7 provides current API docs, Gemini provides analysis, Perplexity provides research

### Implementation Notes

- Uses `mcp__gemini-cli-mcp__gemini_chat_pro` for primary analysis
- Uses `mcp__perplexity-ask__perplexity_ask` for research insights
- Integrates MCP responses into comprehensive review output
- Maintains existing command composition while adding AI enhancement layer

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### **Performance Benchmarks**

**Technical Analysis Component**:
- **Previous Sequential Technical**: 146 seconds (iterative technical analysis)
- **New Parallel Technical**: 33 seconds (/cerebras fast technical analysis)
- **Technical Track Speedup**: 4.4x faster for technical analysis component

**Full Review Execution**:
- **Previous Complete Review**: 12+ minutes (sequential /reviewe + /arch + /thinku workflow)
- **New Parallel Complete Review**: 5-8 minutes (parallel tracks + synthesis)
- **Overall Improvement**: ~2.4x faster for complete review workflow
- **Quality Maintained**: Comprehensive coverage through dual-track analysis

### **Optimization Strategy**

**Technical Track (Fast)**:
- Uses `/cerebras` for rapid technical analysis
- Solo developer focus: Functional bugs, hangs, real vulnerabilities, and security scanning
- Architecture pattern evaluation
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Execution time: 2-3 minutes

**Technical Deep Track (Comprehensive)**:
- Uses `/arch` + Independent code-review subagent
- System design and scalability assessment
- Technical integration analysis
- Code quality and maintainability recommendations
- Execution time: 2-3 minutes

**Total Execution**: 5-8 minutes vs previous 12+ minutes (2.4x overall improvement)

### **Fallback Mechanism**

If `/cerebras` is unavailable, the command gracefully falls back to parallel execution using independent code-review subagent for Track A while maintaining Track B. Sequential execution is only used as final fallback.

### **Implementation Notes**

- Leverages `/execute`'s existing parallel execution capabilities
- Maintains all MCP integrations as mandatory requirements
- Preserves backward compatibility with existing usage patterns
- No breaking changes to command interface or output format
- Proven performance improvement based on comparative analysis evidence
