## ⚡ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Multi-Command Workflows Made Simple

**Action Steps:**
**Before**: Manual step-by-step development
```
1. Analyze the issue manually
2. Write code manually
3. Test manually
4. Create PR manually
5. Handle review comments manually
```

**After**: Single command workflows
```bash
/pr "fix authentication bug"     # → analyze → implement → test → create PR
/copilot                        # → comprehensive PR analysis → apply all fixes
/execute "add user dashboard"   # → plan → implement → test → document
```

### Phase 2: `/pr` - Complete PR Workflow Orchestrator

**Action Steps:**
**What It Does**: End-to-end PR creation from analysis to submission, handling the entire development lifecycle.

**The Magic**: Single command that handles analysis, implementation, testing, and PR creation autonomously.

**Composition Architecture**:
```bash
/pr "fix authentication validation bug"
```

**Internal Workflow Chain**:
1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Issue analysis and root cause identification
   - Codebase understanding and impact assessment
   - Solution design and approach selection

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Code changes with proper error handling
   - Integration testing and validation
   - Documentation updates

3. **Quality Assurance Phase**:
   - Test execution and verification
   - Code review and quality checks
   - Performance impact assessment

4. **Git Workflow Phase**:
   - Branch creation and management
   - Commit message generation
   - PR creation with detailed description

**Real Workflow Example**:
```
/pr "fix login timeout issue"
↓
Analyze login flow → Identify timeout problem → Implement fix →
Run tests → Create branch → Commit changes → Push → Create PR
```

### Phase 1: Preparation & Validation

**Action Steps:**
**Repository Access Verification**:
1. Validate GitHub token and permissions for target repository
2. Check if target repository exists and is accessible
3. Create local staging directory: `/tmp/claude_commands_export_$(date +%s)/`
4. Verify Git configuration for commit operations

**Content Filtering Setup**:
5. Initialize comprehensive export filter system with multiple filter types
6. Exclude project-specific directories and files ($PROJECT_ROOT/, run_tests.sh, testi.sh)
7. Filter out personal/project references ($USER, your-project.com, Firebase specifics)
8. Transform project-specific paths to generic placeholders
9. Set up warning header templates for exported files

### Phase 2: Repository Cleanup & Content Export

**Action Steps:**
**🚨 MANDATORY CLEANUP PHASE**: Remove obsolete files that no longer exist in source repository
```bash

### Phase 5: Step 1: Analyze Current Command System State

**Action Steps:**
First, let me analyze the current state of the command system to provide intelligent README generation:

```python

### Phase 6: Step 2: Execute Python Implementation

**Action Steps:**
```python

### Phase 7: Step 3: LLM-Enhanced README Generation (PRESERVED CAPABILITY)

**Action Steps:**
While the Python implementation generates a comprehensive README, this LLM can provide additional intelligent analysis:

**Command Pattern Analysis**: Analyze which commands are compositional powerhouses
```python

### Phase 8: EXECUTION

**Action Steps:**
**🚀 PRIMARY EXECUTION PATH**: Use the Python implementation for reliable export
```bash
python3 .claude/commands/exportcommands.py
```

**🧠 LLM ENHANCEMENT CAPABILITIES**:
1. Generate contextual README sections based on current command inventory
2. Analyze command composition patterns for documentation
3. Provide intelligent adaptation guidance for different project types
4. Generate usage examples tailored to the exported command set

### Phase 9: IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION

**Action Steps:**
Let me now execute the export using the Python implementation:

```python
import os
import subprocess

### Phase 10: Step 2: Execute Python Implementation

**Action Steps:**
```python

### Phase 11: Step 3: LLM-Enhanced README Generation with Version Intelligence

**Action Steps:**
🚨 **VERSION GENERATION BY LLM**: The LLM now intelligently generates version numbers and change summaries rather than mechanical Python incrementing.

**LLM Version Analysis Process**:
1. **Examine Previous Version**: Check target repo's current README for last version
2. **Analyze Git History**: Review recent commits since last export
3. **Determine Version Bump**:
   - **Patch (x.x.1)**: Bug fixes, minor updates, documentation
   - **Minor (x.1.0)**: New features, significant enhancements
   - **Major (1.0.0)**: Breaking changes, major architecture shifts
4. **Generate Change Summary**: Create meaningful bullet points based on actual changes
5. **Update README_EXPORT_TEMPLATE.md**: Fill LLM_VERSION placeholders with intelligent content

🚨 **CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT**: The export README must showcase the revolutionary command combination capabilities, not just be a basic file listing.

**Enhanced README Requirements**:
6. **⚡ COMMAND COMBINATION SUPERPOWERS** section prominently featured
7. Multi-command workflow examples (`/archreview /thinkultra /fake`)
8. Complete PR lifecycle automation documentation (`/pr fix the settings button`)
9. AI-powered fake code detection capabilities
10. Quick start examples and advanced workflow patterns
11. Professional setup guide with practical value proposition

While the Python implementation generates a comprehensive README, this LLM can provide additional intelligent analysis:

**Command Pattern Analysis**: Analyze which commands are compositional powerhouses
```python

### Phase 12: Step 4: Enhanced Main README.md Update

**Action Steps:**
🚨 **MANDATORY STEP**: Update the main README.md (not create variants) with command combination superpowers:

```bash

### Phase 13: 🎯 Revolutionary Multi-Command Workflows

**Action Steps:**
**Break the One-Command Limit**: Normally, Claude can only handle one command per sentence. This system lets you chain multiple commands in a single prompt, creating sophisticated multi-step workflows.

**Examples**:
1. **Comprehensive PR Review**: `/archreview /thinkultra /fake`
  2. `/archreview` - Architectural analysis of the codebase
  3. `/thinkultra` - Deep strategic thinking about changes
  4. `/fake` - AI-powered detection of placeholder code

5. **Complete PR Lifecycle**: `/pr fix the settings button`
  6. Automatically runs: `/think` → `/execute` → `/push` → `/copilot` → `/review`
  7. Full end-to-end automation with zero manual intervention

### Phase 14: 🔄 Complete Workflow Automation

**Action Steps:**
**The `/copilot` Advantage**: Responds to GitHub comments and makes fixes automatically, handling the entire feedback loop without manual intervention.

### Phase 15: EXECUTION

**Action Steps:**
**🚀 PRIMARY EXECUTION PATH**: Use the Python implementation for reliable export
```bash
python3 .claude/commands/exportcommands.py
```

**🧠 LLM ENHANCEMENT CAPABILITIES**:
1. Generate contextual README sections based on current command inventory
2. Analyze command composition patterns for documentation
3. Provide intelligent adaptation guidance for different project types
4. Generate usage examples tailored to the exported command set

### Phase 16: IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION

**Action Steps:**
Let me now execute the export using the Python implementation:

```python
import os
import subprocess

## 📋 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

# /exportcommands - Export Claude Commands to Reference Repository

🚨 **CRITICAL SUCCESS REQUIREMENT**: This command MUST always print the export PR URL as the final output. The command is NOT complete without providing the PR URL to the user.

🚨 **REPOSITORY SAFETY RULE**: Export operations NEVER delete, move, or modify files in the current repository. Export only copies files for external sharing. The current repository remains completely unchanged.

**Purpose**: Export your complete command composition system to https://github.com/jleechanorg/claude-commands for reference and sharing

**Implementation**: This command delegates all technical operations to the Python implementation (`exportcommands.py`) while providing LLM-driven README generation and intelligent export analysis.

**Usage**: `/exportcommands` - Executes complete export pipeline with automated PR creation

## 🎯 COMMAND COMPOSITION ARCHITECTURE

**The Simple Hook That Changes Everything**: At its core, `/exportcommands` is just a file export script. But what makes it powerful is that it's exporting a complete **command composition system** that transforms how you interact with Claude Code.

### The Composition Pattern

Each command is designed to **compose** with others through a shared protocol:
- **TodoWrite Integration**: Commands break down into trackable steps
- **Memory Enhancement**: Learning from previous executions
- **Git Workflow Integration**: Automatic branch management and PR creation
- **Testing Integration**: Automatic test running and validation
- **Error Recovery**: Smart handling of failures and retries

### Key Compositional Commands Being Exported

**Workflow Orchestrators**:
- `/pr` - Complete PR workflow (analyze → fix → test → create)
- `/copilot` - Autonomous PR analysis and fixing
- `/execute` - Auto-approval development with TodoWrite tracking
- `/orch` - Multi-agent task delegation system

**Building Blocks**:
- `/think` + `/arch` + `/debug` = Cognitive analysis chain
- `/test` + `/fix` + `/verify` = Quality assurance chain
- `/planexec` + `/implement` + `/validate` = Development chain

**The Hook Architecture**: Simple `.md` files that Claude Code reads as executable instructions, enabling complex behavior through composition rather than complexity.

## ⚡ COMMAND COMBINATION SUPERPOWERS

### Combine Multiple Commands in a Single Prompt

**Revolutionary Feature**: Normally, Claude can only handle one command per sentence. This tool lets you string them together in a single prompt, creating sophisticated multi-step workflows.

**Example**: Give this PR a thorough code review with `/archreview /thinkultra /fake`

This runs:
1. `/archreview` - Architectural analysis of the codebase
2. `/thinkultra` - Deep strategic thinking about the changes
3. `/fake` - Detection of placeholder or incomplete code

**The Foundation**: This command combination capability is the foundation for creating more complex, multi-step workflows that would normally require multiple separate interactions.

### Automate Your PR Lifecycle

**Complete Automation**: You can automate your entire pull request workflow with natural language commands.

**Example**: `/pr fix the settings button`

This automatically runs the whole sequence:
- `/think` - Strategic analysis of the settings button issue
- `/execute` - Implementation with auto-approval
- `/push` - Create PR with comprehensive description
- `/copilot` - Respond to GitHub comments and make fixes
- `/review` - Claude's own comprehensive code review

**The `/copilot` Advantage**: The `/copilot` command even responds to GitHub comments and makes fixes automatically, handling the entire feedback loop without manual intervention.

### Detect Fake Code with AI Analysis

**Quality Assurance**: Built-in detection for "fake" code that Claude sometimes generates when pushed too hard.

**The Problem**: When overloaded, Claude sometimes writes placeholder code instead of implementing what you asked for - like just returning success without actual logic.

**The Solution**: If something seems off, run the `/fake` command to systematically detect:
- Placeholder implementations
- Mock responses without real logic
- TODOs disguised as complete features
- Demo code that doesn't actually work

**Smart Detection**: This isn't just pattern matching - it's AI-powered analysis that understands the difference between legitimate code and fake implementations.

## 🔍 COMMAND DEEP DIVE - The Composition Powerhouses

### `/execute` - Auto-Approval Development Orchestrator

**What It Does**: The ultimate autonomous development command that handles everything from planning to implementation with built-in auto-approval.

**The Magic**: Turns complex development tasks into structured, trackable workflows without manual approval gates.

**Composition Architecture**:
```bash
/execute "implement user authentication"
```

**Internal Workflow**:
1. **Phase 1 - Planning**:
   - Complexity assessment (simple/medium/complex)
   - Execution method decision (parallel vs sequential)
   - Tool requirements analysis
   - Timeline estimation
   - Implementation approach design

2. **Phase 2 - Auto-Approval**:
   - Built-in approval bypass: "User already approves - proceeding with execution"
   - No manual intervention required

3. **Phase 3 - TodoWrite Orchestration**:
   - Breaks task into trackable steps
   - Real-time progress updates
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Completion verification

**Real Example** (This very task demonstrates `/execute`):
```
User: /execute "focus on command composition and explain details on /execute..."
Claude:
  Phase 1 - Planning: [complexity assessment, timeline, approach]
  Phase 2 - Auto-approval: "User already approves - proceeding"
  Phase 3 - Implementation: [TodoWrite tracking, step execution]
```

### `/planexec` - Manual Approval Development Planning

**What It Does**: Structured development planning with explicit user approval required before execution.

**The Magic**: Perfect for complex tasks where you want to review the approach before committing resources.

**Composition Architecture**:
```bash
/planexec "redesign authentication system"
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Deep Analysis**: Research existing system, identify constraints, analyze requirements
2. **Multi-Approach Planning**: Present 2-3 different implementation approaches
3. **Resource Assessment**: Timeline, complexity, tool requirements, risk analysis
4. **Approval Gate**: User must explicitly approve before any implementation begins
5. **Guided Execution**: Step-by-step implementation with checkpoints

**When to Use**:
- Complex architectural changes
- When you want oversight of the approach
- High-risk modifications
- Learning new patterns/technologies

### `/copilot` - Autonomous PR Analysis & Comprehensive Fixing

**What It Does**: Comprehensive PR analysis with autonomous fixing of all detected issues - no approval prompts.

**The Magic**: Scans PRs for every type of issue (conflicts, CI failures, code quality, comments) and fixes everything automatically.

**Composition Architecture**:
```bash
/copilot  # Analyzes current PR context
```

**Autonomous Workflow Chain**:
1. **Comprehensive Scanning**:
   - Merge conflicts detection and resolution
   - CI/CD failure analysis and fixes
   - Code review comment processing
   - Quality gate validation

2. **Intelligent Fixing**:
   - Automated conflict resolution with smart merging
   - Test fixes and dependency updates
   - Code style and formatting corrections
   - Documentation and comment updates

3. **Validation Loop**:
   - Re-run tests after each fix
   - Verify merge status and CI success
   - Continue until all issues resolved

**No Approval Required**: Unlike other commands, `/copilot` operates autonomously - perfect for continuous integration workflows.

**Real Example**:
```
PR has: merge conflicts + failing tests + 5 review comments
/copilot
↓
Resolve conflicts → Fix failing tests → Address all comments →
Re-run validation → Push fixes → Verify success
```

### `/orch` - Multi-Agent Task Delegation System

**What It Does**: Delegates tasks to autonomous tmux-based agents that work in parallel across different branches and contexts.

**The Magic**: Spawns specialized agents (frontend, backend, testing, opus-master) that execute tasks independently with full Git workflow management.

**Composition Architecture**:
```bash
/orch "implement user dashboard with tests and documentation"
```

**Multi-Agent Workflow**:
1. **Task Analysis & Delegation**:
   - Break complex task into parallel workstreams
   - Assign to specialized agents based on capabilities
   - Create isolated tmux sessions with agent workspaces

2. **Autonomous Agent Execution**:
   - Each agent gets dedicated branch and workspace
   - Independent execution with full development lifecycle
   - Real-time progress monitoring and coordination

3. **Agent Coordination**:
   - Redis-based inter-agent communication
   - Task dependency management
   - Resource allocation and load balancing

4. **Integration & Delivery**:
   - Agent results aggregation
   - PR creation from agent branches
   - Success verification and reporting

**Agent Types**:
- **Frontend Agent**: UI/UX implementation, browser testing, styling
- **Backend Agent**: API development, database integration, server logic
- **Testing Agent**: Test automation, validation, performance testing
- **Opus-Master**: Architecture decisions, code review, integration

**Cost**: $0.003-$0.050 per task (highly efficient)

**Real Example**:
```
/orch "add user notifications system"
↓
Frontend Agent: notification UI components
Backend Agent: notification API endpoints
Testing Agent: notification test suite
Opus-Master: architecture review and integration
↓
All agents work in parallel → Create individual PRs → Integration verification
```

**Monitoring**:
```bash
/orch monitor agents    # Check agent status
/orch "What's running?" # Current task overview
tmux attach-session -t task-agent-frontend  # Direct agent access
```

# 📚 Reference Export - Adaptation Guide

**Note**: This is a reference export from a working Claude Code project. You may need to personally debug some configurations, but Claude Code can easily adjust for your specific needs.

These configurations may include:
- Project-specific paths and settings that need updating for your environment
- Setup assumptions and dependencies specific to the original project
- References to particular GitHub repositories and project structures

Feel free to use these as a starting point - Claude Code excels at helping you adapt and customize them for your specific workflow.

# Self-Hosted GitHub Runner Setup

## Overview
The `setup-runner-with-drift.sh` script configures a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner with clock drift support. This enables running workflow jobs on your own infrastructure for cost savings or special requirements (e.g., GPU access, specific OS versions).

## Prerequisites
1. **GitHub CLI (`gh`)**: Install from https://cli.github.com/
   ```bash
   # Verify installation
   gh --version
   gh auth status
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions Runner**: Download from https://github.com/actions/runner/releases
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/actions-runner && cd ~/actions-runner
   # Download latest runner (check releases page for current version)
   curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz -L \
     https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.321.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz
   tar xzf actions-runner-linux-x64-2.321.0.tar.gz
   ```

3. **Repository Admin Access**: You need admin access to the target repository to register runners

4. **Clock Sync Capability**: macOS uses `sntp`, Linux typically uses `ntpdate`
   ```bash
   # macOS (already installed)
   sudo sntp -sS time.apple.com

   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install ntpdate
   sudo ntpdate -s time.nist.gov
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Setup (Default Repository)
```bash
# Uses default repository configured in script
./infrastructure-scripts/setup-runner-with-drift.sh
```

### Custom Repository
```bash
# Format: https://github.com/owner/repo
./infrastructure-scripts/setup-runner-with-drift.sh https://github.com/myorg/myrepo

# With custom runner name
./infrastructure-scripts/setup-runner-with-drift.sh https://github.com/myorg/myrepo my-custom-runner
```

### Alternative Format (owner/repo)
```bash
# Script accepts both full URL and owner/repo format
./infrastructure-scripts/setup-runner-with-drift.sh myorg/myrepo my-runner-name
```

## What the Script Does

1. **Uninstalls existing runner service** (if present)
2. **Syncs system clock** using NTP (requires sudo)
3. **Gets registration token** from GitHub API
4. **Configures runner** with repository while clock is synced
5. **Installs and starts service** to run runner as daemon
6. **Verifies runner** is online via GitHub API
7. **Restores clock drift** (if using drift-testing workflow)

## Workflow Integration

### Create Workflow with Self-Hosted Runner
```yaml
name: My Workflow

on: pull_request

jobs:
  try-self-hosted:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, your-runner-label]
    timeout-minutes: 2
    continue-on-error: true

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run your task
        run: echo "Running on self-hosted runner!"

  fallback-github-hosted:
    needs: try-self-hosted
    if: needs.try-self-hosted.result != 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run your task
        run: echo "Running on GitHub-hosted fallback"
```

### Key Workflow Patterns

**Fallback Logic**: Use `needs.<job>.result != 'success'` to trigger GitHub-hosted fallback:
```yaml
fallback-job:
  needs: try-self-hosted
  if: needs.try-self-hosted.result != 'success'  # ✅ Correct - checks actual job result
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**Common Mistake** (DON'T DO THIS):
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - output set at job start, doesn't reflect actual success/failure
try-self-hosted:
  outputs:
    success: ${{ steps.mark-success.outputs.success }}
  steps:
    - run: echo "success=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT  # Set at START = always true!

fallback-job:
  if: needs.try-self-hosted.outputs.success != 'true'  # Never triggers on failure!
```

## Runner Management

### Check Runner Status
```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
./svc.sh status
```

### Stop/Start Runner
```bash
./svc.sh stop
./svc.sh start
```

### View Runner Logs
```bash
# Service logs (macOS)
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/actions.runner.*

# Service logs (Linux)
journalctl -u actions.runner.*
```

### Uninstall Runner
```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
./svc.sh uninstall
./config.sh remove --token $(gh api -X POST repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runners/registration-token --jq '.token')
```

## Cost Savings

Self-hosted runners can significantly reduce CI costs:
- **GitHub-hosted**: ~$0.008/minute for Linux
- **Self-hosted**: Free compute time + infrastructure costs
- **Best for**: Long-running tests, frequent CI jobs, GPU/special hardware needs

## Troubleshooting

### Runner Shows Offline
1. Check service status: `./svc.sh status`
2. Verify clock sync (GitHub rejects >5min drift)
3. Check network connectivity to GitHub
4. Review runner logs for errors

### Registration Token Expired
Tokens expire after 1 hour. Re-run the setup script to get a fresh token.

### Permission Denied Errors
Ensure your GitHub token has `repo` and `admin:org` scopes:
```bash
gh auth refresh -s admin:org,repo
```

## Security Considerations

- Runners execute arbitrary code from workflow files
- Only use self-hosted runners on repositories you trust
- Keep runner software updated
- Use dedicated VMs/containers for isolation
- Don't run untrusted PRs from forks on self-hosted runners

For fork PRs, use the try-self-hosted + fallback pattern to run untrusted code only on GitHub-hosted runners.

## IMPLEMENTATION

**🚨 DELEGATION TO PYTHON IMPLEMENTATION**: All technical export operations are handled by the robust Python implementation (`exportcommands.py`), while this command focuses on LLM-driven analysis and README generation.

# Analyze the current .claude/commands directory

import os
import subprocess

# Get project root

result = subprocess.run(['git', 'rev-parse', '--show-toplevel'], capture_output=True, text=True)
project_root = result.stdout.strip()

# Count commands, hooks, and scripts

commands_dir = os.path.join(project_root, '.claude', 'commands')
hooks_dir = os.path.join(project_root, '.claude', 'hooks')

commands_count = len([f for f in os.listdir(commands_dir) if f.endswith(('.md', '.py'))])
hooks_count = sum([len([f for f in files if f.endswith(('.sh', '.py', '.md'))])
                   for root, dirs, files in os.walk(hooks_dir)])

print(f"📊 Analysis: {commands_count} commands, {hooks_count} hooks detected")
```

# Execute the comprehensive Python implementation

python_script = os.path.join(project_root, '.claude', 'commands', 'exportcommands.py')
result = subprocess.run([python_script], capture_output=True, text=True)

if result.returncode != 0:
    print(f"❌ Export failed: {result.stderr}")
    exit(1)

print(result.stdout)
```

# Identify key workflow orchestrators vs building blocks

compositional_commands = ['pr.md', 'copilot.md', 'execute.md', 'orch.md']
building_blocks = ['think.md', 'test.md', 'fix.md', 'plan.md']

print("🎯 Workflow Orchestrators:", compositional_commands)
print("🧱 Building Blocks:", building_blocks)
```

**Usage Pattern Insights**: Generate intelligent insights about command relationships
```python

# Analyze command interdependencies

print("📊 Command Composition Patterns:")
print("- /pr → /think → /execute → /pushl → /copilot → /review")
print("- /copilot → /execute → /commentfetch → /fixpr → /commentreply")
print("- /execute → /planexec → /think → implementation → /test")
```

# Execute the Python implementation

project_root = subprocess.run(['git', 'rev-parse', '--show-toplevel'],
                            capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.strip()
python_script = os.path.join(project_root, '.claude', 'commands', 'exportcommands.py')

print("🚀 Starting export via Python implementation...")
result = subprocess.run(['python3', python_script], capture_output=True, text=True)

if result.returncode \!= 0:
    print(f"❌ Export failed: {result.stderr}")
    exit(1)

# Print the output (including the critical PR URL)

print(result.stdout)
```

**🚨 CRITICAL**: The above execution will print the PR URL as the final output, fulfilling the critical success requirement.

## POST-EXPORT ANALYSIS

After the Python implementation completes, provide intelligent analysis:

```python

# Analyze export results for documentation enhancement

print("\n📊 Export Analysis:")
print("✅ Command composition system exported successfully")
print("✅ Directory exclusions applied per requirements")
print("✅ Content filtering applied for project portability")
print("✅ One-click installation script generated")
print("✅ Comprehensive README with adaptation guide created")
```

                   for root, dirs, files in os.walk(hooks_dir)])

print(f"📊 Analysis: {commands_count} commands, {hooks_count} hooks detected")
```

# Execute the comprehensive Python implementation

    exit(1)

print(result.stdout)
```

# Identify key workflow orchestrators vs building blocks

# Claude Commands - Command Composition System

⚠️ **REFERENCE EXPORT** - This is a reference export from a working Claude Code project. These commands have been tested in production but may require adaptation for your specific environment. Claude Code excels at helping you customize them for your workflow.

Transform Claude Code into an autonomous development powerhouse through simple command hooks that enable complex workflow orchestration.

## ⚡ COMMAND COMBINATION SUPERPOWERS

### 🤖 AI-Powered Code Quality Detection

**Smart Fake Code Detection**: Built-in `/fake` command uses AI analysis (not just pattern matching) to detect:
- Placeholder implementations that look real but do nothing
- Mock responses without actual logic
- TODOs disguised as complete features
- Demo code that doesn't actually work

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

Get started immediately with these powerful command combinations:

```bash

# Comprehensive code analysis

/arch /think /fake

# Full PR workflow automation

/pr implement user authentication

# Advanced testing with auto-fix

/test all features and if any fail /fix then /copilot
```

[Include rest of enhanced README content with installation, setup, and advanced workflows...]

echo "✅ Enhanced main README.md with command combination superpowers"
```

🚨 **CRITICAL LEARNING**: Always update the actual target file (README.md), never create variants like README_UPDATED.md.

# Execute the Python implementation

project_root = subprocess.run(['git', 'rev-parse', '--show-toplevel'],
                            capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.strip()
python_script = os.path.join(project_root, '.claude', 'commands', 'exportcommands.py')

print("🚀 Starting export via Python implementation...")
result = subprocess.run(['python3', python_script], capture_output=True, text=True)

if result.returncode \!= 0:
    print(f"❌ Export failed: {result.stderr}")
    exit(1)

# Print the output (including the critical PR URL)

print(result.stdout)
```
