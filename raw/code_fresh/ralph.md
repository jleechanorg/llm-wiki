# /ralph - Ralph Automation (portable across repositories)

Use this command when you need autonomous multi-iteration execution with the
portable Ralph toolkit. Ralph can target **any repository**.

## Claude Code vs Non-CLI Routing

**Important**: This command detects how it's being invoked and routes accordingly:

- **`run` command**: Uses `/loop` for iteration - Claude handles each iteration directly with full context
- **Other commands** (`status`, `dashboard`): Falls back to `ralph.sh` script for compatibility
- **Non-Claude CLI**: Always falls back to `ralph.sh` script

The detection works by checking for `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` environment variable (set by Claude Code).

### Routing Table

| Command | From Claude Code | From Other CLI |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| `run` | `/loop N /e ralph_iteration` | `ralph.sh run` |
| `status` | `ralph.sh status` | `ralph.sh status` |
| `dashboard` | `ralph.sh dashboard` | `ralph.sh dashboard` |

This allows Claude Code to handle iteration loops natively while preserving all other Ralph functionality.

## Run Ralph against any repository

1. Ensure Ralph toolkit is exported locally (from `/localexportcommands`):
   ```bash
   test -x ~/ralph/ralph.sh
   ```
2. Choose a target repository and confirm it is a git checkout:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/target-repo
   git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
   ```
3. Create or customize runtime files in `~/ralph/`:
   - `~/ralph/prd.json` — If missing, `ralph.sh run` creates a minimal skeleton
     and exits; edit it with your task/branch/goal, then re-run.
   - `~/ralph/progress.txt` — Auto-created on first run if missing.
   - These state files are currently global/shared in `~/ralph`, so run one
     workspace at a time unless you intentionally swap state between runs.
4. Run Ralph and point it to the target repository via `--workspace`:
   ```bash
   # Default tool from RALPH_TOOL (default: claude)
   ~/ralph/ralph.sh run --workspace /path/to/target-repo 10

   # Explicit tools
   ~/ralph/ralph.sh run --tool claude --workspace /path/to/target-repo 10
   ~/ralph/ralph.sh run --tool codex --workspace /path/to/target-repo 10
   ~/ralph/ralph.sh run --tool amp --workspace /path/to/target-repo 10
   ```
5. Monitor status:
   ```bash
   ~/ralph/ralph.sh status --watch
   ```

## Claude Code Execution (via /loop)

When invoked from Claude Code, this command uses `/loop` for iteration:

**Default (10 iterations)**:
```bash
/loop 10 /e ralph_iteration --workspace /path/to/repo
```

**With custom tool**:
```bash
/loop 10 /e ralph_iteration --workspace /path/to/repo --tool codex
```

Each iteration reads `prd.json` and `progress.txt`, implements unpassed stories,
runs quality checks, commits, and updates `passes` status.

## Optional: run from this repo directly

If you specifically want to run the in-repo copy:

```bash
./ralph/ralph.sh run --workspace "$PWD" 10
```

Unlike the portable `~/ralph` workflow, the in-repo copy keeps runtime state with
that repository's own Ralph directory.

## Routing Logic

```bash
# Parse the command
COMMAND="${1:-run}"

# Route based on command and invocation context
if [ -n "${CLAUDE_SESSION_ID:-}" ]; then
    # Claude Code invocation
    case "$COMMAND" in
        run)
            # Use /loop for iteration. Only consume arg 2 when it is numeric.
            case "${2:-}" in
                ''|*[!0-9]*)
                    MAX_ITERATIONS="10"
                    /loop "$MAX_ITERATIONS" /e ralph_iteration "${@:2}"
                    ;;
                *)
                    MAX_ITERATIONS="$2"
                    /loop "$MAX_ITERATIONS" /e ralph_iteration "${@:3}"
                    ;;
            esac
            ;;
        status|dashboard|help)
            # Use shell script for other commands
            ~/ralph/ralph.sh "$@"
            ;;
        *)
            ~/ralph/ralph.sh "$@"
            ;;
    esac
else
    # Non-Claude CLI: use shell script for everything
    ~/ralph/ralph.sh "$@"
fi
```

## Sanity check before handoff

- Confirm the target repo is on a dedicated branch for the task.
- Confirm `progress.txt` is present (or create as needed).
- After completion, verify iteration result and return final PR/story status.
