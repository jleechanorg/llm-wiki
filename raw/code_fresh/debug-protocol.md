```

**Summary Checkpoint:** Before proceeding, clearly restate the problem using the evidence above.

### Phase 0.5: Context-Aware Mandatory Code Walkthrough

**Action Steps:**
🚨 **AUTOMATED CONTEXT DETECTION**: This phase automatically triggers for complex debugging scenarios requiring systematic code analysis.

**🎯 Walkthrough Triggers** (If ANY detected, Phase 0.5 is MANDATORY):
1. **Version Comparison Issues**: Keywords like "V1 vs V2", "old vs new", "migration", "upgrade"
2. **API Integration Problems**: Multiple system involvement, external service interactions
3. **Architecture Debugging**: Component interaction issues, data flow problems
4. **User Evidence Contradictions**: User screenshots/reports differ from automated observations
5. **Complex System Issues**: Multiple files/modules involved, cross-component failures

**⚠️ MANDATORY USER EVIDENCE PRIMACY CHECK**:
6. **Critical Rule**: If user provided screenshots, logs, or behavioral observations, treat as GROUND TRUTH
7. **Required Action**: Compare user evidence with automated observations FIRST
8. **Investigation**: If discrepancies exist, ask "Why am I seeing different results than the user?"
9. **No Assumptions**: Never dismiss user evidence as environmental or user error

**📋 SYSTEMATIC CODE WALKTHROUGH PROTOCOL**:

**Step 1: Component Mapping (5 minutes)**
Using Serena MCP for semantic code analysis:
```
mcp__serena__find_symbol --name_path "[component_name]" --relative_path "[file_path]"
mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview --relative_path "[directory]"
```
10. Identify equivalent functions/components between systems (e.g., V1 resumeCampaign vs V2 GamePlayView)
11. Map corresponding API endpoints, data handlers, UI components
12. Document component relationships and dependencies

**Step 2: Side-by-Side Code Analysis (10-15 minutes)**
Using systematic comparison methodology:
```
mcp__serena__find_symbol --name_path "[function1]" --include_body true
mcp__serena__find_symbol --name_path "[function2]" --include_body true
```
13. Compare equivalent functions for missing logic, API calls, state management
14. Identify architectural differences (server-side vs client-side patterns)
15. Check for missing imports, configuration, or initialization code
16. Verify error handling and edge case coverage

**Step 3: Execution Path Tracing**
Systematic flow analysis:
17. **User Action → API Call**: Trace user interaction to backend request
18. **API → Business Logic**: Follow request through service layer
19. **Business Logic → Data Layer**: Track database/storage interactions
20. **Data Layer → Response**: Verify response formation and return path
21. **Response → UI Update**: Confirm UI state updates and rendering

**Step 4: Data Flow Verification**
Validate data transformations:
22. **Input Format Verification**: Check data format expectations
23. **Transformation Logic**: Verify data conversion between components
24. **State Management**: Confirm state updates at each step
25. **Output Format Validation**: Check final data format matches UI expectations

**Step 5: Gap Analysis & Evidence Synthesis (5 minutes)**
Systematic comparison results:
26. **Missing Components**: Functions, API calls, or logic present in working version but absent in broken version
27. **Different Implementations**: Variations in approach that could cause behavioral differences
28. **Data Format Mismatches**: Input/output format incompatibilities
29. **Architectural Differences**: Fundamental approach differences (e.g., server vs client rendering)

**🎯 WALKTHROUGH SUCCESS CRITERIA**:
30. [ ] All equivalent components identified and compared
31. [ ] Complete execution path traced in both systems (if comparative debugging)
32. [ ] Data flow verified at each transformation point
33. [ ] Specific gaps or differences documented with file:line references
34. [ ] User evidence discrepancies explained or flagged for investigation

**⏱️ TIME-BOXED APPROACH**:
35. **Quick Wins** (0-5 min): Check most obvious differences first
36. **Systematic Deep Dive** (5-20 min): Complete component comparison and flow tracing
37. **Escalation Criteria** (20+ min): If no clear gaps found, escalate complexity or broaden scope

**📚 Native Memory Integration**: Capture walkthrough patterns with native memory:

**Native Memory Enhancement**: Uses native memory for improved debug pattern discovery:
38. **Smart Search**: Use `memory_search` for debugging patterns
39. **Enhanced Pattern Discovery**: Use native memory for better debugging insights
40. **Result Integration**: Combine searches for comprehensive debug analysis

**Enhanced Integration**: Capture walkthrough patterns for future reuse:
```
memory_save({
  "content": "Debug walkthrough for [system] at [timestamp]: Components Compared: [specific functions/modules analyzed], Execution Path: [traced flow], Gap Identified: [specific missing functionality], Resolution Time: [total time]",
  "category": "debugging",
  "tags": ["walkthrough", "system", "pattern"]
})
```

**Summary Checkpoint**: Document specific gaps, differences, or missing components found during walkthrough. These findings directly inform Phase 1 hypothesis formation.

### Phase 1: Research & Root Cause Analysis

**Action Steps:**
**🔬 Research Phase (for complex/novel issues):**
For complex issues, unknown technologies, or patterns requiring broader investigation, leverage `/research` for systematic analysis:

**When to Use Research:**
1. Novel error patterns not seen before
2. Technology stack unfamiliar to debugging context
3. Issues requiring architectural understanding
4. Pattern analysis across multiple systems
5. Security vulnerability assessment
6. Performance debugging requiring domain knowledge

**Research Integration** (`/research`):
7. **Research Planning**: Define specific questions about the debugging context
8. **Multi-source Information Gathering**: Search across multiple engines for similar issues
9. **Analysis Integration**: Synthesize findings to inform hypothesis generation
10. **Pattern Recognition**: Identify common patterns in similar debugging scenarios

**Research Query Examples:**
```
/research "TypeError undefined property authentication middleware Express.js"
/research "Memory leak debugging Node.js background tasks patterns"
/research "Race condition data corruption multi-user database transactions"
```

**🧠 Root Cause Analysis (Enhanced by Walkthrough Evidence):**

Leverage sequential thinking capabilities enhanced by Phase 0.5 walkthrough findings to rank potential causes by:
(a) likelihood given the error message, research findings, AND walkthrough gap analysis
(b) evidence in the code snippets, walkthrough comparisons, and similar documented cases
(c) impact if true based on research patterns and systematic code analysis

**Evidence Integration**: Use walkthrough findings to inform hypothesis formation:
11. **Component Analysis**: Incorporate missing functions/API calls identified in Step 2
12. **Execution Path Gaps**: Consider flow interruptions found in Step 3 tracing
13. **Data Flow Issues**: Include format mismatches discovered in Step 4 verification
14. **User Evidence Reconciliation**: Integrate user observation explanations from walkthrough

**Investigation Focus:** Start by investigating the top 2 most likely causes enhanced by walkthrough evidence. If both are ruled out during validation, consider expanding to additional hypotheses informed by walkthrough patterns.

**Top Hypothesis (Walkthrough-Enhanced):** [e.g., "Data Flow Gap: V2 GamePlayView missing `apiService.getCampaign(campaignId)` call that V1 resumeCampaign() function makes, causing display of default content instead of loaded campaign data"]

**Reasoning (Evidence-Based):** [e.g., "Walkthrough comparison revealed V1 resumeCampaign() makes API call to load existing campaign data and populates UI, while V2 GamePlayView useEffect only creates new content. User screenshots showing minimal content vs rich content confirms this gap. Research shows this is common in server-side vs client-side migration patterns."]

**Secondary Hypothesis (Walkthrough-Informed):** [State your second most likely cause based on walkthrough evidence and research findings]

**Walkthrough Evidence Summary:** [Summarize specific gaps, missing components, or architectural differences found during systematic comparison that inform hypothesis ranking]

**Research-Enhanced Analysis:** [If research was conducted, summarize how findings combined with walkthrough evidence influenced hypothesis ranking and validation approach]

**Summary Checkpoint:** Summarize the primary and secondary hypotheses, including any research insights, before proposing a validation plan.

### Phase 2: Validation Before Fixing (Critical!)

**Action Steps:**
Create a precise, testable plan to validate the top hypothesis without changing any logic.

**Logging & Validation Plan:**
1. **Action:** [e.g., "Add `console.log('User object before admin check:', JSON.stringify(user));` at Line 42 of `auth-service.js`"]
2. **Rationale:** [e.g., "This will prove whether the `user` object is `null` or `undefined` immediately before the point of failure"]

**Expected vs. Actual Results:**

| Checkpoint | Expected (If Hypothesis is True) | Actual Result |
|------------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| [Test condition] | [Expected outcome] | [Fill after testing] |
| [Log output] | [Expected log content] | [Fill after testing] |

**Summary Checkpoint:** Confirm the validation plan is sound and the hypothesis is clearly testable.

### Phase 3: Surgical Fix

**Action Steps:**
**⚠️ Only proceed if Phase 2 successfully validates the hypothesis.**

**Proposed Fix:**
```diff
// Provide the code change in a diff format for clarity
1. [problematic code]
+ [corrected code]
```

**Justification:** Explain why this specific change solves the root cause identified and validated earlier.

**Impact Assessment:** Document what this change affects and potential side effects.

### Phase 4: Final Verification & Cleanup

**Action Steps:**
**Testing Protocol:**
1. [ ] Run all original failing tests - confirm they now pass
2. [ ] Run related passing tests - confirm no regressions
3. [ ] Test edge cases related to the fix
4. [ ] Remove any temporary debugging logs added in Phase 2

**Visual/UI Verification (if applicable):**
5. [ ] **Screenshot comparison:** Before/after visual verification
6. [ ] **DOM state verification:** CSS properties match expected values
7. [ ] **Asset loading verification:** Network requests successful
8. [ ] **Anti-bias check:** Test what should NOT be working

**Documentation Updates:**
9. [ ] Update relevant documentation if fix changes behavior
10. [ ] Add test cases to prevent regression
11. [ ] Document lessons learned for future debugging

### Walkthrough-Triggering Issues (Phase 0.5 Automatically Activated)

```

## 📋 REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION

# Debug Protocol Command

**Usage**: `/debug-protocol [issue description]` or `/debugp [issue description]` (alias)

**Purpose**: Apply comprehensive forensic debugging methodology for complex issues requiring systematic evidence gathering, hypothesis validation, and documented root cause analysis.

## 🔬 Research-Backed Methodology

Based on software engineering research showing:
- **30% faster troubleshooting** with structured approaches vs ad-hoc debugging
- **80% bug detection** with validation-before-fixing methodologies
- **60% defect reduction** with systematic validation processes
- **Evidence-driven debugging** shows measurable improvement over intuition-based approaches

## 🛠️ DEBUGGING PROTOCOL ACTIVATED 🛠️

## 🚨 STRICT PROTOCOLS & BEHAVIORAL CONSTRAINTS 🚨

### 🚨 TOTAL FAILURE PROTOCOL ENFORCEMENT

**MANDATORY**: Apply [Total Failure Protocol](total_failure.md) before declaring any debugging results.

**DEBUGGING-SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS:**
- ❌ NO "framework is working" statements until the SPECIFIC bug is detected
- ❌ NO "debugging protocol worked" claims until the ORIGINAL ISSUE is resolved
- **BUILD MUST WORK:** If code doesn't compile or tests fail, it's complete failure

### ⚡ RELENTLESS DEBUGGING RULES

- **Failed Validation:** If validation disproves the hypothesis, return to Phase 1 with new findings
- **Alternative Reasoning:** After failed validation, consider less obvious causes (race conditions, memory leaks, upstream corruption)
- **Test Integrity:** Never modify existing tests to make them pass
- **Root Cause Focus:** Focus strictly on the validated root cause, not symptoms
- **One Change at a Time:** Implement one precise change at a time
- **NO STOPPING:** Continue debugging until the ORIGINAL problem is completely solved

## When to Use `/debugp` vs `/debug`

**Use `/debugp` for:**
- Complex production issues requiring forensic analysis
