## ⚡ EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE
**When this command is invoked, YOU (Claude) must execute these steps immediately:**
**This is NOT documentation - these are COMMANDS to execute right now.**
**Use TodoWrite to track progress through multi-phase workflows.**

## 🚨 EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: 🗺️ CONVERGENCE LOOP (9-STEP CYCLE)

**Action Steps:**
**LOOP UNTIL CONVERGED OR MAX ITERATIONS REACHED (Default: 10 iterations)**:

### Phase 2: Step 2: Strategic Planning and Tool Analysis

**Action Steps:**
**Command**: `/planexec` - Create comprehensive strategy with command index optimization
1. **CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION**: Use command index instead of reading full .claude/commands/ files
2. **Command Index**: Load /tmp/converge/{branch}/command-cache/index.json (71K chars vs 677K chars)
3. **Context Savings**: 89.5% reduction in command discovery phase
4. **Smart Selection**: Filter commands by context level, execution time, and goal type
5. **Lazy Loading**: Defer reading full command .md files until execution phase
6. **Efficiency**: Use command summaries for planning, full docs for execution only
7. Remember slash commands are EXECUTABLE instructions, not documentation
8. Break goal into actionable phases using appropriate slash command orchestration
9. Estimate resource requirements and timeline with tool-specific considerations
10. Identify potential obstacles and mitigation strategies
11. Create detailed TodoWrite tracking system with command-specific tasks

### Phase 3: Step 3: Plan Review & Confidence Assessment

**Action Steps:**
**Action**: Review the plan using strategic analysis with confidence scoring
1. Critically analyze plan against available slash command library
2. **Confidence Assessment**: Evaluate goal clarity, pattern recognition, and complexity
  3. **High (≥75%)**: Clear goal + recognizable patterns → Standard execution
  4. **Medium (50-74%)**: Some ambiguity → Enhanced logging, continue
  5. **Low (<50%)**: Major uncertainty → Extra validation, continue
6. Display confidence level with reasoning for transparency
7. Optimize tool selection for maximum efficiency
8. Identify command synergies and integration opportunities
9. Validate approach against best practices and constraints

### Phase 4: Step 4: Plan Approval

**Action Steps:**
**AUTONOMOUS APPROVAL**: All plans are automatically approved and proceed without human intervention
1. System confidence assessment determines execution approach
2. High-confidence plans: Proceed with optimal execution strategy
3. Lower-confidence plans: Use more conservative execution with additional validation
4. All plans proceed autonomously - no human approval gates

### Step 5: Execution Phase

**Action Steps:**
**Command**: `/cerebras` - Fast high-quality code generation using direct Cerebras API script (NOT Gemini MCP)
1. **Script Location**: `cerebras/cerebras_direct.sh` (relative to cerebras.md location)
2. **Note**: Uses Cerebras API directly, not mcp__gemini-cli-mcp tools
3. Execute plan using optimal slash command selection
4. Monitor progress and adapt execution as needed
5. Handle errors and obstacles with intelligent retry
6. Maintain detailed execution logs for learning

### Phase 6: Step 6: Validation Against Goals

**Action Steps:**
**Command**: `/goal --validate` against the goals - Objective success measurement
1. Check each success criterion systematically using structured validation
2. Measure progress quantitatively with evidence collection
3. Identify gaps between actual and expected outcomes
4. Document validation results with concrete evidence for learning phase
5. Generate completion percentage and remaining work analysis

### Phase 7: Step 8: Enhanced Status Report Generation

**Action Steps:**
**Command**: `/status` - Generate comprehensive convergence status report with confidence data
1. **Report Location**: Save to `docs/pr-guidelines/{PR_NUMBER}/convergence-status-{timestamp}.md`
2. **Progress Summary**: Current completion percentage and criteria status
3. **Confidence Data**: Current confidence level, reasoning, and historical accuracy
4. **Resource Summary**: Token usage, iterations completed, elapsed time
5. **Iteration Analysis**: Commands used, success rates, and performance metrics
6. **Learning Documentation**: Patterns discovered, failures overcome, optimizations applied
7. **Convergence Trajectory**: Progress velocity, estimated completion, next iteration strategy
8. **Decision Context**: Evidence for convergence/continuation decision with objective rationale

### Phase 8: Step 9: Convergence Decision

**Action Steps:**
**LOOP CONTROL**: Start again with Step 1 (Goal Definition) and loop N times or stop when it's done

🚨 **MANDATORY AUTONOMY CHECKPOINT**: Before making convergence decision, verify autonomy preservation:
1. ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Stopping for user approval when goal not 100% achieved
2. ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Waiting for user acknowledgment of partial progress
3. ❌ **FORBIDDEN**: Implicit approval requests through progress celebration
4. ✅ **REQUIRED**: Continue immediately if success criteria < 100% and iterations < max

**Convergence Decision Logic**:
5. **IF CONVERGED**: All PRIMARY success criteria met → STOP with completion report
  6. PR is MERGEABLE status (not conflicting)
  7. All SERIOUS GitHub comments addressed (blocking issues resolved)
  8. CI passes (no failed checks)
  9. No critical errors or failures detected
10. **IF GOOD ENOUGH**: Core objectives achieved even if minor issues remain → STOP
  11. Primary goal accomplished (90%+ criteria met)
  12. Diminishing returns threshold reached (last 2 iterations <5% improvement)
  13. PR is in good mergeable state with only cosmetic issues remaining

  **Threshold Definitions:**
  14. **"90%+ criteria met"**: Calculate as (number of primary success criteria achieved) / (total number of primary success criteria). For example, if there are 10 criteria and 9 are met, progress = 90%. Criteria may include PR mergeability, CI passing, blocking comments resolved, etc.
  15. **"Last 2 iterations <5% improvement"**: Measure progress using a quantifiable validation score (e.g., percentage of criteria met, CI pass rate, or resolved blocking issues). If the increase in score between the last two iterations is less than 5% (e.g., from 88% to 90%), this threshold is considered reached.
  16. **Example**: If in iteration 8, 8/10 criteria are met (80%), and in iteration 9, 9/10 are met (90%), the improvement is 10%. If in iteration 10, 9.5/10 are met (95%), the improvement is 5%. If subsequent iterations show <5% improvement, convergence is triggered.
17. **IF STALLED**: No meaningful progress in validation for 2+ iterations → STOP with stall report
  18. Same validation scores for 2+ consecutive iterations
  19. Unable to improve PR mergeability status
  20. Repeated execution failures on same issue
21. **IF IMPROVING**: Meaningful progress on PRIMARY criteria → Continue (up to 2 more iterations, but never exceeding the hard cap)
  22. Measurable improvement in PR status or CI state
  23. Successful resolution of blocking GitHub comments
  24. NOTE: The hard cap of 10 iterations always applies, overriding all other limits
25. **IF MAX ITERATIONS**: Absolute limit reached → STOP with partial report

🔒 **AUTONOMY PRESERVATION**: No user intervention allowed during convergence decision process

**PR CONTEXT AWARENESS**: When goal involves PR work:
26. Primary success = PR is MERGEABLE on current branch
27. ❌ NEVER create additional PRs as "solutions"
28. ✅ ALWAYS work within existing PR constraints
29. ✅ STAY ON CURRENT BRANCH throughout convergence

### Phase 9: No User Interaction Points

**Action Steps:**
**Eliminated User Dependencies**:
1. ❌ No clarifying questions during goal definition
2. ❌ No approval gates for plan execution
3. ❌ No manual intervention requests during errors
4. ❌ No user confirmation for validation results
5. ❌ No human decision points in iteration loops

### Phase 10: Universal Composition Execution

**Action Steps:**
**Command Selection Protocol**: Choose appropriate slash command for each task type:
1. **Code/Script Generation**: **Command**: `/cerebras` - Fast high-quality code generation via direct Cerebras API script (`cerebras/cerebras_direct.sh` relative to cerebras.md) - NOT Gemini MCP
2. **PR Review Processing**: **Command**: `/copilot` - Complete PR comment processing
3. **Test Suite Management**: **Command**: `/test` - Run and fix failing tests
4. **Complex Multi-Step**: **Command**: `/orch` - Delegate to orchestration agents
5. **Planning & Analysis**: **Command**: `/execute` - Break down complex goals

### Phase 11: Execution Benefits

**Action Steps:**
1. **Parallel Processing**: Independent agents can execute simultaneously
2. **Failure Isolation**: Agent failures don't crash entire convergence workflow
3. **Resume Capability**: Session state enables restart from any step
4. **Debug Clarity**: Each agent's input/output clearly defined and traceable
5. **Scalability**: Add more agents without increasing main context

## 🚀 Context Optimization Architecture

### Lazy Loading Patterns

**Context-Efficient File Loading**: Load files only when needed for execution, not during planning

```markdown
**Planning Phase** (Steps 1-3):
- Goal Processing: Use independent agent (5K tokens max)
- Command Discovery: Use command index (71K chars vs 677K chars)
- Plan Review: Work with summaries only
- Context Usage: ~80K tokens (vs 200K+ traditional)

**Execution Phase** (Steps 5+):
- Command Details: Load full .md files only when executing specific commands
- File Operations: Read files on-demand during actual operations
- Resource Usage: Targeted loading based on execution needs
- Context Management: Release completed context between iterations
```

### Command Index System Integration

**89.5% Context Reduction in Command Discovery**:
- **Index Location**: `/tmp/converge/{branch}/command-cache/index.json`
- **Content**: 106 command summaries with purpose, context requirements, execution time
- **Usage**: Planning phase uses index, execution phase loads full command docs
- **Benefits**: Instant command discovery, smart filtering, parallel planning capability

### Agent-Based Architecture

**Independent Processing Agents**:
- **Goal Processing**: Direct inline goal analysis with structured output
- **Planning Agent**: Future enhancement for command selection and sequencing
- **Execution Agents**: Parallel task execution with minimal shared context
- **Validation Agent**: Success criteria checking with targeted file access

### Session State Management

**Filesystem-Based Coordination**:
```
/tmp/converge/{branch_name}/
├── session-{timestamp}/
│   ├── goal-spec.json          # Goal processor output
│   ├── execution-plan.json     # Planning phase results
│   ├── current-state.json      # Progress tracking
│   └── results/               # Execution outputs
└── command-cache/             # Command index system
    └── index.json
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with clear success criteria** - Ambiguous goals lead to endless loops
2. **Use TodoWrite for tracking** - Maintains visibility of progress
3. **Leverage parallel execution** - Use orchestration for independent tasks
4. **Validate frequently** - Don't wait until the end to check progress
5. **Document decisions** - Keep audit trail of what was tried
6. **Know when to stop** - Set maximum iterations to prevent infinite loops
7. **🚀 NEW: Optimize context usage** - Use lazy loading and agent architecture for efficiency
8. **🚀 NEW: Leverage command index** - Use summaries for planning, full docs for execution

## 🎯 CORRECTED ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

**Universal Composition**: /converge systematically calls other slash commands using explicit "**Command**: /commandname" pattern

**Iterative Convergence**: Continues plan→execute→validate→learn cycles until ALL success criteria met

**Measurable Success**: Verifies completion objectively, not through assumption

**Command Integration**: Uses appropriate specialist commands (/cerebras, /copilot, /test, /orch) based on goal type

**Remember**: /converge achieves goals by orchestrating other slash commands intelligently, not by trying to do everything itself. It's a meta-command that coordinates specialized tools until convergence is achieved.
