CAMPAIGN SUMMARY
================
Title: Celestial Imperium: Order Under Tyranny
Character: Ser Arion
Setting: Assiah
Description: You are Ser Arion, a 16 year old honorable knight on your first mission, sworn to protect the vast Celestial Imperium. For decades, the Empire has been ruled by the iron-willed Empress Sariel, a ruthless tyrant who uses psychic power to crush dissent. While her methods are terrifying, her reign has brought undeniable benefits: the roads are safe, commerce thrives, and the Imperium has never been stronger. But dark whispers speak of the Dragon Knights - an ancient order that once served the realm before mysteriously vanishing. As you journey through this morally complex world, you must decide: will you serve the tyrant who brings order, or seek a different path?
AI Personalities: Narrative, Mechanics
Options: Companions, Modified World

Now, how would you like to design Ser Arion using D&D 5e mechanics?
1. **[AIGenerated]:** I'll create a complete D&D version of Ser Arion based on his description and the world lore.
2. **[StandardDND]:** You choose Ser Arion's race (Human, given context) and class (Fighter, Paladin, etc.) from D&D options.
3. **[CustomClass]:** We'll create custom mechanics for Ser Arion's unique knightly abilities within the Celestial Imperium.

Which option would you prefer? (1, 2, or 3)""",
