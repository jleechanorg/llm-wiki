## Prompt Loading System

### Loading Order
The prompts are loaded in a specific order to ensure proper instruction hierarchy:

1. **master_directive.md** - Loaded first to establish authority
2. **game_state_instruction.md** - Loaded second for data structure authority
3. **Debug instructions** - Generated dynamically for technical functionality
4. **Selected prompts** - Loaded based on campaign configuration
5. **System reference** - D&D SRD loaded last for rule lookup

### Conditional Loading
Not all prompts are loaded for every request:

- **Always Loaded**: master_directive.md, game_state_instruction.md, dnd_srd_instruction.md
- **Conditionally Loaded**: narrative_system_instruction.md, mechanics_system_instruction.md
- **Context Dependent**: character_template.md (only during character creation)

## Prompt Management

### File Format
- **Format**: Markdown (.md) files
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Structure**: Hierarchical with clear sections
- **Length**: Varies by complexity (500-3000 words each)

### Content Guidelines
1. **Clear Instructions**: Unambiguous directives
2. **Hierarchical Structure**: Organized with headers and sections
3. **Examples**: Concrete examples for complex concepts
4. **Consistency**: Consistent terminology and formatting
5. **Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of domain area

### Version Control
- All prompts are version controlled with the codebase
- Changes require testing to ensure AI behavior remains consistent
- Critical prompts (master_directive, game_state) require careful review

## Prompt Architecture

### Instruction Hierarchy
```
1. Master Directive (Highest Authority)
   ├── Core AI personality and behavior
   ├── Instruction conflict resolution
   └── Meta-rules for prompt handling

2. Game State Instructions (Second Authority)
   ├── Data structure requirements
   ├── JSON response format
   └── State management protocols

3. Feature-Specific Instructions (Third Authority)
   ├── Narrative guidelines
   ├── Mechanics implementation
   └── Character templates

4. Reference Materials (Lowest Authority)
   ├── D&D SRD rules
   ├── World content
   └── Historical context
```

### Prompt Integration
- **System Instructions**: Combined into single system instruction
- **Dynamic Content**: Generated based on game state and context
- **Contextual Additions**: World content, debug instructions, etc.
- **Token Management**: Optimized for AI model token limits

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Prompts
1. **Identify Need**: Determine what behavior needs guidance
2. **Define Scope**: Clearly scope the prompt's responsibility
3. **Write Content**: Follow existing format and style
4. **Test Integration**: Ensure compatibility with existing prompts
5. **Update Loading**: Modify llm_service.py to load new prompt

### Modifying Existing Prompts
1. **Backup Current**: Save current version before changes
2. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, testable modifications
3. **Test Behavior**: Verify AI responses remain appropriate
4. **Document Changes**: Record what was changed and why
5. **Monitor Impact**: Watch for unintended behavioral changes

### Content Standards
- **Specificity**: Provide specific, actionable instructions
- **Clarity**: Use clear, unambiguous language
- **Completeness**: Cover all relevant scenarios
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent tone and terminology
- **Testability**: Include guidance that can be validated

## Archived Prompts

### Removed Prompts
The following prompts were removed from the active prompt set:
- **calibration_instruction.md** (2,808 words) - AI calibration guidelines
- **destiny_ruleset.md** (1,012 words) - Destiny RPG system rules
- **dual_system_quick_reference.md** (354 words) - Multi-system support
- **attribute_conversion_guide.md** (822 words) - Attribute system conversion
- **character_sheet_template.md** (659 words) - Character sheet formatting

### Archival Reasons
- **Complexity Reduction**: Simplified instruction set for better AI performance
- **System Consolidation**: Moved from dual-system to D&D-only
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced token usage for better response times
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain fewer, more focused prompts

## Performance Considerations

### Token Usage
- **Total Tokens**: ~15,000-20,000 tokens for full prompt set
- **Optimization**: Regular review to minimize token usage
- **Prioritization**: Most important instructions loaded first
- **Conditional Loading**: Only load necessary prompts for each request

### Response Quality
- **Instruction Fatigue**: Too many instructions can reduce compliance
- **Clarity**: Clear, specific instructions improve response quality
- **Hierarchy**: Well-defined hierarchy prevents instruction conflicts
- **Testing**: Regular testing ensures prompts work as intended

## Testing Prompts

### Validation Methods
1. **Response Quality**: Manual review of AI responses
2. **Behavior Consistency**: Consistent behavior across sessions
3. **Rule Compliance**: Adherence to game rules and mechanics
4. **Format Compliance**: Proper JSON formatting and structure
5. **Edge Cases**: Handling of unusual or unexpected scenarios

### Test Scenarios
- **Character Creation**: Complete character creation flow
- **Combat Scenarios**: Various combat situations
- **Story Generation**: Different narrative situations
- **State Management**: Complex state updates
- **Error Handling**: Invalid inputs and edge cases

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Review**: Monthly review of prompt effectiveness
2. **Update**: Keep prompts current with game changes
3. **Optimize**: Regularly optimize for token usage
4. **Test**: Continuous testing with new AI model versions
5. **Archive**: Remove obsolete or redundant content

### Quality Metrics
- **Response Accuracy**: AI responses match expected behavior
- **Rule Compliance**: Adherence to game mechanics
- **Consistency**: Consistent responses across similar situations
- **User Satisfaction**: Positive user feedback on AI behavior
- **Performance**: Response time and token efficiency

## Integration

### Code Integration
- **Loading**: Handled by `llm_service.py`
- **Caching**: Prompts are cached after first load
- **Updates**: Require application restart to take effect
- **Constants**: Prompt paths defined in `constants.py`

### Configuration
- **Prompt Selection**: Based on campaign settings
- **Feature Flags**: Some prompts loaded conditionally
- **Debug Mode**: Additional instructions for debugging
- **World Content**: Dynamic content based on world selection
