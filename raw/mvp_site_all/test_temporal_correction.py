"""
Tests for temporal correction loop to ensure player input preservation.

This test verifies that when the LLM generates a backward time jump,
the original player input is always preserved and saved to Firestore.

NOTE: Temporal corrections are currently DISABLED (MAX_TEMPORAL_CORRECTION_ATTEMPTS=0)
to reduce multiple LLM calls. This test verifies the core behavior still works:
- Original player input is preserved
- Backward time responses are accepted without retry
