TDD integration tests for concurrent request handling

Tests verify that the application:
1. Can handle multiple simultaneous requests
2. Responds correctly under concurrent load
3. Maintains consistency across concurrent requests
4. Does not have race conditions
5. Properly uses connection pooling

These are integration tests that verify the entire concurrency stack:
- Gunicorn configuration (workers × threads)
- Flask application
- MCP client connection pooling
- Request handling under load
