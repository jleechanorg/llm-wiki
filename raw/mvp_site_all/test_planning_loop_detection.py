"""
RED TEST: Planning Loop Detection for Social Encounters

This test reproduces the bug where:
1. User selects a social action (e.g., "Press the Logical Argument")
2. LLM describes the situation but doesn't roll dice
3. LLM presents same/similar options again
4. Loop repeats indefinitely - narrative never progresses

The Action Execution Rule (game_state_instruction.md line 239-244) says:
- EXECUTE the chosen action with dice rolls
- DO NOT present more sub-options
- Anti-Loop Rule: If same action selected twice, ALWAYS execute on second selection

This test should FAIL until the prompt is strengthened to enforce resolution.
