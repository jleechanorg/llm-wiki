"""
End-to-end test for mission auto-completion with completed_missions auto-initialization.

Tests the fix for the bug where older campaigns don't have the completed_missions field,
preventing missions from auto-completing.

Bug Context:
- Production Nocturne campaign had active_missions but no completed_missions field
- Missions stayed in active_missions even after narrative completion
- Required manual god mode intervention to close

This test validates:
1. Auto-initialization of completed_missions field when active_missions exists
2. Mission completion logic moves missions from active to completed
3. Older campaign states are migrated transparently
