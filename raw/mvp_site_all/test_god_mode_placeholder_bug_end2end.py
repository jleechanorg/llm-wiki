End-to-end test reproducing God Mode placeholder bug.

BUG: Real user campaigns show placeholder text on Turn 0:
    "[Character Creation Mode - Story begins after character is complete]"

Instead of proper character creation narrative that should be generated immediately.

ROOT CAUSE: god_mode_data (string format) is not parsed into god_mode (dict format),
so is_god_mode_with_character check fails and placeholder is shown.

This test reproduces the bug by:
1. Creating campaign with god_mode_data as string (matching real user flow)
2. Checking opening story (Turn 0) for placeholder text
3. Verifying that character creation narrative is NOT generated

Caught between an oath to a ruthless tyrant who enforces a prosperous peace and the call of a chaotic dragon promising true freedom, a young knight must decide whether to slaughter innocents to preserve order or start a war to reclaim the world's soul. | Description: # Campaign summary

You are Ser Arion, a 16 year old honorable knight on your first mission, sworn to protect the vast Celestial Imperium. For decades, the Empire has been ruled by the iron-willed Empress Sariel, a ruthless tyrant who uses psychic power to crush dissent. While her methods are terrifying, her reign has brought undeniable benefits: the roads are safe, trade flourishes, and the common people no longer starve or fear bandits. You are a product of this "Silent Peace," and your oath binds you to the security and prosperity it provides.

Your loyalty is now brutally tested. You have been ordered to slaughter a settlement of innocent refugees whose very existence has been deemed a threat to the Empress's perfect, unyielding order. As you wrestle with this monstrous command, the weight of your oath clashes with the humanity you feel for the innocent lives before you.

You are now caught between duty and conscience. Do you uphold your oath and commit an atrocity, believing the sacrifice of a few is worth the peace and safety of millions? Or do you break your vow and defy the Empress, knowing that rebellion could plunge the world back into chaos? This single choice will define your honor and your path in an empire where security is bought with blood.

**Your Character:**

- **Name:** Ser Arion val Valerion
- **Age:** 16
- **Class:** Level 1 Paladin (Oath of the Crown, sworn to Empress Sariel and the Laws of the Imperium)
- **Alignment:** Neutral (Lawful Neutral leaning) — Your choices determine whether you become a champion of justice or an instrument of tyranny.
- **Background:** Noble Knight of House Valerion

**Default Build (Level 1 Paladin):**
- **Stats:** Str 16, Con 14, Cha 16 | **HP:** 12 | **AC:** 20
- **Skills:** Persuasion, Intimidation
- **Features:** Divine Sense (4 uses), Lay on Hands (5 HP pool)

**Gear:**
- **Valerion Plate:** Heavy plate armor (AC 18), house sigil
- **"Duty's Edge":** Longsword (+5 to hit, 1d8+3 slashing)
- **Shield:** +2 AC, bearing the Two Suns of the Imperium
- **The Gryphon Helm:** Your iconic helmet"""
