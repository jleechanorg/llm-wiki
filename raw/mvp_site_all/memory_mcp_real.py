"""Memory MCP Integration - Architectural Limitation Documentation

IMPORTANT: This module demonstrates why Python cannot directly integrate with Claude Code's MCP tools.

The fundamental issue:
- MCP tools (like mcp__memory-server__search_nodes) exist in Claude's execution environment
- These are NOT Python modules and cannot be imported or called from Python code
- They are only accessible to the Claude AI assistant, not to the Python runtime

This module serves as documentation of this architectural limitation.
