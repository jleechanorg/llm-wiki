"""
Gunicorn configuration for WorldArchitect.AI production deployment
Optimized for I/O-bound workloads (MCP, Firestore, Gemini API calls)

This configuration uses gthread workers for improved concurrency while maintaining
compatibility with all Python libraries (Firebase, Firestore, Gemini SDK).

Performance Improvement:
- Before: 1 worker (sync) = 1 concurrent request
- After: (2*CPU+1) workers × 4 threads = 12+ concurrent requests on 1 CPU

Note: Worker and thread configuration logic has been extracted to infrastructure package
for testability and reusability across the project.
