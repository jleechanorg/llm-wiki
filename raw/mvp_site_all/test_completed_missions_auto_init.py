"""Test completed_missions auto-initialization for older campaigns.

This test validates the fix for the bug where older campaigns don't have
the completed_missions field, preventing mission auto-completion.

Bug Context:
- Production Nocturne campaign had active_missions but no completed_missions
- Missions couldn't auto-complete because there was nowhere to move them
- Required manual god mode intervention
