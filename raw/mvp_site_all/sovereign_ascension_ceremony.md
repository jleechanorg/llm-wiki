# Sovereign Ascension Ceremony (The Multiversal Upgrade)

**Purpose:** Guide the transition from Divine Leverage tier to the Sovereign Protocol (Multiversal Campaign).

## Trigger Conditions

This ceremony activates when:
- `universe_control >= 70` in custom_campaign_state (from ANY campaign tier)
- OR specific narrative milestone indicating multiversal dominion

## Pre-Ceremony Analysis

Before beginning the ceremony, analyze the PC's established themes from the campaign:
1. Dominant playstyle (combat, social, stealth, magic)
2. Key decisions and their patterns
3. Allies and their roles
4. Domain/portfolio if in divine tier
5. Personality traits and motivations

Use this to generate their unique **Sovereign Logic**.

## Ceremony Structure

### Phase 1: The Threshold

```
[MULTIVERSAL THRESHOLD ACHIEVED]

*The boundaries of a single universe can no longer contain your power. Reality itself buckles under the weight of your dominion. You have achieved what few beings in all of existence have accomplished - absolute control over the fundamental laws of a cosmos.*

But a single universe is merely a grain of sand on an infinite beach.

Beyond the veil of your reality lies the Pan-Substrate - an infinite landscape of 1,000 rival Sovereigns, each commanding their own cosmic domains. Some have existed for eons. Others, like you, are newly risen.

Your universe-spanning power makes you a threat. And threats are dealt with.

[AGGRO METER: 8/10 - LETHAL VELOCITY DETECTED]
Your sudden ascension has triggered a defensive alert across the Pan-Substrate.
```

### Phase 2: Sovereign Logic Generation

Based on campaign analysis, present the PC's unique Sovereign Logic:

```
[ANALYZING CAMPAIGN THEMES...]

Your journey has been marked by: [Key Theme Analysis]

Your Sovereign Logic - the metaphysical law you impose on reality - is:

**"[SOVEREIGN LOGIC NAME]"**

[Description of how this Logic manifests]

Examples:
- "Offensive Entropy" - Reality decays at your command, order dissolves to chaos
- "Celestial Bureaucracy" - All systems bow to your administrative will
- "Bioluminescent Assimilation" - Life absorbs, adapts, consumes, evolves
- "Temporal Recursion" - Time loops, repeats, and serves your purposes
- "Necrotic Sovereignty" - Death is not an end, but a beginning under your rule

Does this Logic resonate with your vision? Or would you define your own?
```

### Phase 3: Sub-Deity Elevation

Identify key NPCs from the campaign for elevation:

```
[HEGEMONY FORMATION]

Your current organization elevates to a "Hegemony" - a multiversal faction.

The following beings have proven worthy of Sub-Deity status:

1. **[NPC Name]** - Recommended Portfolio: [War/Logistics/Culture/Research]
   History: [Brief summary of their role in the campaign]

2. **[NPC Name]** - Recommended Portfolio: [Portfolio]
   History: [Brief summary]

3. **[NPC Name]** - Recommended Portfolio: [Portfolio]
   History: [Brief summary]

Which allies will you elevate? You may also choose to add others from your journey.
```

### Phase 4: Stat Conversion

Convert stats to Sovereign system:

**God Power (GP):** Highest ability score modifier (from your highest attribute modifier)
**Substrate Points (SP):** Starting at 1 SP (1,000 universes equivalent)

```
[STAT CONVERSION TO SOVEREIGN PROTOCOL]

Your capabilities have been quantified in multiversal terms:

**GOD POWER (GP):** [Value]
  - Derived from your highest attribute modifier
  - Used for all Sovereign-level checks

**SUBSTRATE POINTS (SP):** 1 SP
  - 1 SP = 1,000 Universes
  - Your starting domain: 1,000 Universes
  - SP serves as both currency AND health

**STARTING RANK:** ~800/1000
  - Administrator Tier (100+ SP required for promotion)
  - You are a new power in an old game

**AGGRO METER:** 8/10 (LETHAL)
  - Your rapid ascension has drawn hostile attention
  - Reduce through diplomacy or destroy threats
```

### Phase 5: Imperial Context

Establish the political landscape:

```
