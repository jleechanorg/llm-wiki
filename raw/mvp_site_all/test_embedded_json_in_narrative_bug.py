"""
Red-Green test for embedded planning block JSON appearing raw in narrative.

BUG REPRODUCTION:
When the LLM includes raw JSON like {"thinking": ..., "choices": ...} in the
narrative text, this JSON should be stripped from the displayed narrative since
the planning_block is a separate structured field.

The user reported seeing raw JSON like:
{
    "thinking": "The family has been completely broken...",
    "choices": {
        "magical_oaths_binding": {...},
        ...
    }
}

This should NOT appear in the narrative text - it should only be in the
separate planning_block field.
