# Scratchpad for Branch: dev1314

## Subagent 2 Execution Results

### Summary
Searched all prompt template files and found planning block references in 4 files that need cleaning:

### Files with Planning Block References

1. **game_state_instruction.md**
   - Line 22: `"planning_block": "The --- PLANNING BLOCK --- with character options - ALWAYS VISIBLE TO PLAYERS"`
   - Line 48-49: Instructions about planning block field being required
   - Line 52-60: Format example showing planning block structure with "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---"
   - Line 89: `- Put --- PLANNING BLOCK --- in planning_block field`
   - Line 134: `**REQUIRED: Every STORY MODE response must include the planning block in the planning_block field.**`
   - Multiple sections explaining planning block formatting and templates

2. **master_directive.md**
   - Line 85: References planning blocks as part of narrative authority
   - No specific instructions about narrative formatting that need removal

3. **mechanics_system_instruction.md**
   - Line 11: `**PLANNING BLOCK REQUIREMENT**: During character creation, ALWAYS include a planning block...`
   - References planning blocks but in context of JSON field usage

4. **narrative_system_instruction.md**
   - Line 4: `- Planning Block Protocol and Templates`
   - References that protocols are defined in game_state_instruction.md

### Changes Needed

The main file that needs cleaning is **game_state_instruction.md**. It contains:

1. Instructions showing planning blocks formatted with "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" delimiters
2. Template examples that show planning blocks as narrative text blocks
3. Instructions that could be interpreted as requiring narrative planning blocks

### Specific Changes to Make:

1. **game_state_instruction.md**:
   - Remove or update the format examples that show "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" as text
   - Clarify that planning blocks should ONLY go in the JSON `planning_block` field
   - Update templates to not show the dashed delimiter format
   - Keep the instruction that planning_block is a required JSON field

2. **Other files**: No changes needed - they already reference putting planning blocks in JSON fields appropriately.

### Next Steps
Ready to update game_state_instruction.md to remove narrative planning block instructions while keeping JSON field requirements.

### Updates Completed

Successfully updated **game_state_instruction.md** with the following changes:

1. **Line 22**: Changed from `"The --- PLANNING BLOCK --- with character options"` to `"Character options and choices"`
2. **Lines 48-60**: Removed the "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" delimiter format from the field description
3. **Line 89**: Changed from `"Put --- PLANNING BLOCK --- in planning_block field"` to `"Put character options in planning_block field"`
4. **Minimal Planning Block Template**: Removed "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" header
5. **Standard Planning Block Template**: Removed "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" header, clarified it's example content for JSON field
6. **Deep Think Planning Block Template**: Removed "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" header, clarified it's example content for JSON field

### Result
All references to narrative planning blocks with "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" delimiters have been removed or updated. The prompts now clearly indicate that planning blocks should only go in the JSON `planning_block` field, not in the narrative text.

- **Integration test, broader than just planning blocks**

#### 3. Tests That May Have Narrative Parsing (Deprecated)

Based on grep results, these files reference parsing planning blocks from text:
- test_main_interaction_structured_fields.py
- test_structured_response_extraction.py
- test_think_block_protocol.py
- Various UI tests

### Analysis of Redundancies

#### Major Redundancies Found:

1. **Multiple JSON corruption fix tests**:
   - test_planning_block_json_corruption_fix.py
   - test_planning_block_json_first_fix.py
   - Part of test_planning_block_enforcement.py (structured response tests)

2. **Overlapping enforcement tests**:
   - test_planning_block_enforcement.py has 15+ test methods
   - Many test similar scenarios with slight variations
   - TestStructuredResponsePlanningBlocks class duplicates JSON field testing

3. **Think command testing duplication**:
   - test_planning_block_enforcement.py tests think keywords
   - test_planning_block_simplified.py tests think keywords again
   - Likely test_think_block_protocol.py also tests this

4. **API failure fallback tested multiple times**:
   - test_planning_block_enforcement.py
   - test_planning_block_json_corruption_fix.py
   - Likely in other files too

### Consolidation Plan

#### 1. Merge Similar Tests
**Merge these files into one comprehensive test_planning_block_core.py:**
- test_planning_block_enforcement.py (keep as base)
- test_planning_block_json_corruption_fix.py (merge JSON parsing tests)
- test_planning_block_json_first_fix.py (merge JSON-first tests)

**Rationale**: All test core planning block functionality with overlapping scenarios

#### 2. Keep Separate Focused Tests
**Keep these as-is:**
- test_planning_block_simplified.py (specific to prompt simplification feature)
- test_planning_blocks_ui.py (UI-specific, different concern)

#### 3. Remove Redundant Test Cases
From test_planning_block_enforcement.py, consolidate:
- Multiple think keyword tests → one parameterized test
- Multiple mode detection tests → one comprehensive test
- Red/Green test pairs that test the same thing → keep only the "green" test

#### 4. Remove Narrative Parsing Tests
Search for and remove any tests that:
- Parse planning blocks from narrative text
- Look for "--- PLANNING BLOCK ---" in narrative
- Extract planning content from response text (deprecated)

#### 5. Tests to Check and Potentially Remove
Need to examine these files for narrative parsing:
- test_think_block_protocol.py
- test_main_interaction_structured_fields.py
- Any UI tests that parse planning blocks from narrative

### Proposed Final Structure

1. **test_planning_block_core.py** (~400 lines)
   - Core validation and enforcement
   - JSON field updates
   - Mode-specific behavior
   - API failure handling

2. **test_planning_block_prompts.py** (current test_planning_block_simplified.py)
   - Prompt template testing
   - Keyword detection

3. **test_planning_blocks_ui.py** (keep as-is)
   - UI parsing and rendering

4. **Remove**:
   - test_planning_block_json_corruption_fix.py
   - test_planning_block_json_first_fix.py
   - Redundant test methods
   - Any narrative parsing tests

This would reduce from 20+ test files with planning block tests to 3 focused files, eliminating ~50% of the test code while maintaining full coverage.

## Subagent 4 Execution Results

### Summary
Successfully added robustness improvements for planning block edge case handling. The system now gracefully handles null values, empty strings, malformed content, and various edge cases.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Backend Validation (narrative_response_schema.py)
Added comprehensive validation methods:
- `_validate_string_field()` - Handles null/non-string values for all string fields
- `_validate_list_field()` - Handles null/non-list values for list fields
- `_validate_planning_block()` - Special validation for planning blocks with:
  - JSON detection warning
  - Length validation (warns if >5000 chars)
  - Null byte removal
  - Type conversion with error handling

#### 2. Frontend Error Handling (app.js)
Enhanced `parsePlanningBlocks()` function with:
- Null/undefined input checking
- Type validation and conversion
- JSON-like content detection
- Try-catch error handling with fallback display
- Robust index checking for string operations
- XSS-safe sanitization of choice data
- Validation of choice objects before rendering

#### 3. CSS Error Styling (planning-blocks.css)
Added `.planning-block-error` class with:
- Warning-style background color
- Pre-formatted text display for raw content
- Theme-aware styling (light/dark modes)
- Responsive design support

#### 4. Comprehensive Test Coverage (test_planning_block_robustness.py)
Created new test file with 10 test cases covering:
- Null and empty planning blocks
- Non-string type handling (int, list, dict)
- JSON-like content detection
- Extremely long content (>5000 chars)
- Null byte removal
- Special characters and XSS attempts
- All structured fields validation
- Edge cases in to_dict() method

### Edge Cases Now Handled

1. **Null/Empty Values**
   - Null → empty string
   - Empty string → preserved
   - Whitespace-only → preserved as-is

2. **Type Errors**
   - Non-strings converted to strings
   - Failed conversions logged and default to empty string
   - Lists/dicts handled gracefully

3. **Malformed Content**
   - JSON-like strings detected and warned
   - Null bytes removed automatically
   - Very long content warned but preserved

4. **Frontend Parsing**
   - Missing choice IDs handled
   - Invalid indices caught
   - Parse errors show raw content as fallback

5. **Security**
   - XSS attempts preserved in backend (for data integrity)
   - Frontend sanitizes before rendering
   - HTML entities properly escaped

### Test Results
All 10 edge case tests passing:
- Proper validation occurring
- Warnings logged for suspicious content
- No crashes on malformed input
- Graceful degradation throughout

### Logging Improvements
Added appropriate logging at each validation point:
- WARNING: Type mismatches, JSON content, long content
- ERROR: Null bytes, conversion failures
- All with descriptive messages for debugging
