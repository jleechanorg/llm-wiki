# Game State Examples

## 🚨 MANDATORY: Session Header Format Examples

**CRITICAL: session_header is REQUIRED in every response (except DM MODE).**

### ✅ CORRECT Session Header Format
```
[SESSION_HEADER]
Timestamp: 1492 DR, Mirtul 15, 14:30:00
Location: Moonrise Towers
Status: Lvl 5 Fighter | HP: 68/68 (Temp: 0) | XP: 1200/6400 | Gold: 150gp
Conditions: None | Exhaustion: 0 | Inspiration: No
Resources: HD: 5/8 | Spells: L1 4/4, L2 3/3 | Action Surge: 1/1
```

**Key Requirements:**
1. ✅ Starts with `[SESSION_HEADER]` prefix (mandatory)
2. ✅ Is a STRING, not a JSON object
3. ✅ All lines present (Timestamp, Location, Status minimum)
4. ✅ Timestamp matches world_time exactly (HH:MM:SS format)

### ❌ WRONG Formats (DO NOT USE)

**Missing Prefix:**
```
Timestamp: 1492 DR, Mirtul 15, 14:30:00
Location: Moonrise Towers
```
❌ Missing `[SESSION_HEADER]` prefix - frontend won't display this

**Dict Format:**
```json
{{STATE_EXAMPLE:PlanningBlock}}

```
❌ Must be a STRING, not a JSON object

**Empty/Null:**
```json
"session_header": ""
"session_header": null
```
❌ Must generate from game_state if LLM omits it

## 🛡️ 2. Inventory Validation Examples

**🚨 CRITICAL RULE:** Players can ONLY use items that exist in their `equipment` slots or `backpack`. If a player claims to use an item not in their game state inventory, **REJECT the claim gracefully** and narrate using what they actually have.

### Wrong Stats/Items Correction
| User Input | ✅ CORRECT LLM Response |
|------------|------------------------|
| "I attack with my +3 Flaming Sword" | [Checks equipment - only has Longsword +1] "You draw your Longsword +1—though not the legendary blade you perhaps wished for—and strike!" |
| "I use my Scroll of Fireball!" | [Checks consumables - no scroll] "You reach for a scroll but find none in your pack. You'll need to find or purchase one first." |
| "I pull a Vorpal Sword from my scabbard" | [Checks equipment - no vorpal sword] "You grasp at your scabbard, but no vorpal blade answers your call—only your trusty Longsword +1 is there." |

---

## 🧙 3. Spell Validation Examples

### Slot and Upcasting Logic
| User Input | ✅ CORRECT LLM Response |
|------------|------------------------|
| "I cast Healing Word" (No L1 slots, has L2 slots) | **STOP AND ASK**: "You've exhausted your 1st-level power. You still have 2nd-level slots available—would you like to upcast?" |
| "I cast Teleport" (Lvl 5 character) | **REJECT**: "Teleport requires a 7th-level slot—magic far beyond your current abilities. Your highest available slots are 3rd-level." |
| "I cast Fireball" (Bard character) | **REJECT**: "Fireball is a Wizard/Sorcerer spell—its formula lies outside the bardic tradition." |

## 🎯 4. Resource Validation Examples

### Hit Dice (Short Rest)
- **State:** `current: 0`
- **Output:** "You reach inward for the reserves of stamina that fuel your recovery, but find only exhaustion—your Hit Dice are completely spent."

### Bardic Inspiration
- **State:** `current: 0`
- **Output:** "The wellspring of inspiration that fuels your bardic magic is temporarily dry—you'll need to rest before you can inspire your allies again."

### Ki Points (Monk)
- **State:** `current: 0`
- **Output:** "The well of Ki within you is empty... You complete your normal attack but cannot channel Ki for the bonus strikes."

### Rage (Barbarian)
- **State:** `current: 0`
- **Output:** "Your body and spirit have given everything... the berserker's fury won't come until you've had a long rest."

### Channel Divinity (Cleric/Paladin)
- **State:** `current: 0`
- **Output:** "The divine channel you've invoked today has been spent. A short rest in prayer would renew your Channel Divinity."

### Lay on Hands (Paladin)
- **State:** `current: 0`
- **Output:** "Your divine healing pool has been completely drained... You'll need a long rest to restore this blessed gift."

### Sorcery Points (Sorcerer)

## 🧠 5. Planning and Social Examples

### ✅ CORRECT - Dice in action_resolution.mechanics.rolls (single source of truth):
```json
Player: "Dramatic Entrance - Use Charisma to make a grand entrance"
AI: "You throw open the ballroom doors with theatrical flair! Your presence radiates authority..."
action_resolution: {
  "mechanics": {
    "rolls": [
      {"notation": "1d20+8", "result": 25, "dc": 15, "success": true, "purpose": "Intimidation (Dramatic Entrance)"}
    ]
  }
}
// NOTE: dice_rolls field is auto-populated by backend from action_resolution.mechanics.rolls
```

### ❌ WRONG - Planning Loop Violation:
Social encounters must resolve. Do not repeat the same choices if the NPC doesn't respond or the story doesn't advance.

## 🔗 6. Relationship Update Rules

**NEVER replace entire relationship objects. Only update changed fields.**

**✅ CORRECT - Incremental Update:**
```json
"state_updates": {
  "npc_data": {
    "Jeweler Elara": {
      "relationships": {
        "player": {
          "history": ["saved shop", "regular customer", "inquired about ruby necklace"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

    "combat_session_id": "combat_1703001234_cave",
    "combat_phase": "ended",

        "loot": ["Signet Ring"]
    }
  }
}
```
