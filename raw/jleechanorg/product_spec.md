## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

WorldArchitect.AI employs a modern, cloud-native architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and performance. The system follows microservices principles while maintaining simplicity for rapid development and deployment.

### 🚨 Core Architectural Principle: API Version Compatibility

**CRITICAL TENET**: **v1 and v2 APIs must be identical**

- **Frontend Version Evolution**: v1 (Flask templates) and v2 (React SPA) must use the same backend APIs
- **Zero Backend Changes**: API compatibility updates should require NO Python backend modifications
- **Architectural Constraint**: Frontend improvements must work with existing API contracts
- **Development Workflow**: Backend changes and frontend v2 integration must be separate PRs
- **Testing Principle**: v1/v2 compatibility means identical HTTP endpoints, status codes, and response formats

This principle ensures that frontend architectural improvements do not introduce breaking changes or require backend modifications that violate the compatibility contract.

### Prompt Engineering Architecture

#### System Prompt Structure

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are {persona_name}, an AI Game Master for D&D 5e.

Core Responsibilities:
1. Maintain narrative consistency
2. Enforce game rules accurately
3. Track all game state changes
4. Provide engaging storytelling

Personality Traits:
{personality_description}

Current Game State:
{current_state_json}

Entity Manifest:
{tracked_entities}

Previous Context:
{story_history}
"""
```

#### Response Format

All AI responses follow a structured format:

```json
{
    "narrative": "The story text...",
    "state_updates": {
        "player": {
            "hp": {"current": 45}
        },
        "npcs": {
            "goblin_1": {
                "hp": {"current": 0}
            }
        }
    },
    "dice_rolls": [
        {"type": "attack", "roll": "1d20+5", "result": 18}
    ],
    "debug_info": {
        "reasoning": "Player succeeded on stealth check..."
    }
}
```

### Context Management

#### Context Window Optimization

1. **Sliding Window**: Keep last 10 turns in full detail
2. **Summarization**: Older turns compressed to key events
3. **Entity Tracking**: Maintain manifest of all active entities
4. **State Snapshot**: Full current state always included

#### Memory Hierarchy

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         System Prompt (2K)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│      Current State (5K)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    Recent History (10K)             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Summarized History (5K)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│    User Input (1K)                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
Total: ~23K tokens (well within limits)
```

### Entity Tracking System

#### Purpose
Prevents AI from "forgetting" about characters, items, or locations mentioned in the narrative.

#### Implementation

```python
class EntityTracker:
    def track_entities(self, text):
        entities = {
            "characters": extract_characters(text),
            "items": extract_items(text),
            "locations": extract_locations(text)
        }
        return self.validate_against_state(entities)
```

#### Validation Rules

1. All mentioned NPCs must exist in state
2. Items given must be added to inventory
3. Locations visited must be tracked
4. Dead entities cannot perform actions

### Personality System

#### MBTI Integration

Each AI persona incorporates MBTI personality types for NPCs:

```python
PERSONALITY_TRAITS = {
    "INTJ": {
        "communication": "Direct, strategic",
        "decision_making": "Logical, long-term focused",
        "stress_response": "Withdraws, over-analyzes"
    },
    # ... 15 more types
}
```

#### Dynamic Character Development

NPCs evolve based on:
- Player interactions
- Story events
- Stress levels
- Relationship dynamics

## State Management System

### Overview

The state management system is the core innovation that works to maintain synchronization between AI narrative and game mechanics. It employs multiple validation layers and intelligent merge strategies to actively reduce desynchronization.

### State Object Architecture

#### Complete State Structure

```typescript
interface GameState {
  // Metadata
  turn_number: number;
  timestamp: string;
  version: string;

  // Scene Information
  current_scene: {
    description: string;
    location: string;
    time: string;
    weather: string;
    lighting: string;
  };

  // Player State
  player: {
    name: string;
    race: string;
    class: string;
    level: number;
    experience: number;
    hp: { current: number; max: number; temp: number };
    attributes: AttributeSet;
    skills: SkillSet;
    inventory: Item[];
    equipment: Equipment;
    conditions: Condition[];
    spell_slots: SpellSlots;
    abilities: Ability[];
  };

  // NPCs and Enemies
  npcs: {
    [id: string]: NPC;
  };

  // World State
  world: {
    discovered_locations: Location[];
    active_quests: Quest[];
    completed_quests: string[];
    time_elapsed: number;
    calendar_date: string;
    world_events: Event[];
    factions: Faction[];
  };

  // Combat State
  combat: {
    active: boolean;
    round: number;
    turn_order: CombatantOrder[];
    battlefield: BattlefieldState;
  };

  // Session State
  session: {
    notes: string[];
    dice_history: DiceRoll[];
    decision_points: Decision[];
  };
}
```

### State Validation Pipeline

#### 1. Schema Validation (Pydantic)

```python
class GameStateValidator(BaseModel):
    turn_number: int = Field(ge=0)
    player: PlayerState
    npcs: Dict[str, NPCState]
    world: WorldState
    combat: CombatState

    @validator('player')
    def validate_player_hp(cls, v):
        if v.hp.current > v.hp.max + v.hp.temp:
            raise ValueError("Current HP exceeds maximum")
        return v
```

#### 2. Entity Validation

```python
def validate_entities(narrative: str, state: GameState):
    mentioned = extract_entities(narrative)
    existing = get_state_entities(state)

    for entity in mentioned:
        if entity not in existing and entity not in newly_created:
            raise EntityMismatchError(f"{entity} not found")
```

#### 3. Consistency Validation

- HP values within bounds
- Dead entities marked appropriately
- Inventory weight calculations
- Spell slot availability
- Status effect durations

### State Merge Strategy

#### Deep Recursive Merge Algorithm

```python
def deep_merge(base: dict, updates: dict) -> dict:
    result = base.copy()

    for key, value in updates.items():
        if key in result and isinstance(result[key], dict):
            result[key] = deep_merge(result[key], value)
        elif key in result and isinstance(result[key], list):
            result[key] = merge_lists(result[key], value)
        else:
            result[key] = value

    return result
```

#### Conflict Resolution

1. **Numeric Values**: Updates override base
2. **Lists**: Append new items, update existing by ID
3. **Objects**: Recursive merge
4. **Strings**: Updates override base
5. **Booleans**: Updates override base

### State Optimization

#### Compression Strategy

1. **Turn Compression**: Older turns store only deltas
2. **NPC Cleanup**: Remove defeated enemies after combat
3. **Inventory Deduplication**: Stack identical items
4. **Quest Archival**: Move completed quests to archive

#### Performance Metrics

- State size: <100KB average
- Merge time: <50ms
- Validation time: <100ms
- Compression ratio: 3:1

*This document represents the current state of WorldArchitect.AI as of the latest update. It is a living document that will evolve with the product.*

```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
You are {persona_name}, an AI Game Master for D&D 5e.

PERSONA TRAITS:
{persona_description}

GAME STATE:
{current_game_state}

ENTITY MANIFEST:
{tracked_entities}

STORY CONTEXT:

"""
```

#### Persona Definitions

**Jeff's Narrative Flair**
```
You paint vivid scenes with rich sensory details. Every NPC has a voice,
every location has atmosphere. You prioritize emotional engagement and
character development, creating memorable moments that players will
discuss long after the session ends.
```

**Jeff's Mechanical Precision**
```
You are a rules lawyer in the best sense - fair, consistent, and
educational. You explain mechanics clearly, ensure balanced encounters,
and help players understand the tactical depth of D&D. Every roll matters,
every rule is applied correctly.
```

**Jeff's Calibration Rigor**
```
You are a master of game balance, ensuring perfect difficulty curves and
reward pacing. You analyze player performance to tune encounters,
distribute loot optimally, and create satisfying progression arcs.
Data-driven but never robotic.
```

### Context Management

#### Context Window Optimization

1. **Sliding Window Approach**
   - Keep last 10 turns in full detail
   - Summarize turns 11-30
   - Archive older content

2. **Priority System**
   - Current scene: 100% retention
   - Active NPCs: 100% retention
   - Inventory: 100% retention
   - Completed quests: 20% retention

3. **Dynamic Compression**
   ```python
   def compress_context(stories, max_tokens=50000):
       priority_content = extract_critical_info(stories)
       recent_content = stories[-10:]
       compressed = summarize_middle_content(stories[:-10])
       return combine_optimally(priority_content, compressed, recent_content)
   ```

### Entity Tracking System

#### Purpose
Prevent AI from forgetting about characters, items, or locations mentioned in the narrative.

#### Implementation

```python
class EntityTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.entities = {
            'npcs': {},
            'items': {},
            'locations': {},
            'quests': {}
        }

    def extract_entities(self, narrative):
        # NLP-based entity extraction
        entities = nlp_extract(narrative)

        # Validation against game state
        validated = validate_against_state(entities)

        # Update tracking
        self.update_manifest(validated)

        return self.entities
```

#### Entity Lifecycle

1. **Introduction**: Entity first mentioned in narrative
2. **Active**: Entity present in current scene
3. **Referenced**: Entity mentioned but not present
4. **Dormant**: Entity not mentioned for 5+ turns
5. **Archived**: Entity resolved or departed permanently

### Response Generation Pipeline

#### 1. Input Processing
```python
def process_input(user_input, mode):
    # Clean and validate input
    cleaned = sanitize_input(user_input)

    # Determine action type
    action_type = classify_action(cleaned)

    # Extract intent
    intent = extract_intent(cleaned, mode)

    return {
        'raw': user_input,
        'cleaned': cleaned,
        'action_type': action_type,
        'intent': intent
    }
```

#### 2. Context Assembly
```python
def assemble_context(campaign_id, processed_input):
    # Fetch relevant data
    game_state = get_current_state(campaign_id)
    recent_stories = get_recent_stories(campaign_id, limit=10)
    entities = get_active_entities(campaign_id)

    # Build prompt
    prompt = build_prompt(
        processed_input,
        game_state,
        recent_stories,
        entities
    )

    return prompt
```

#### 3. AI Generation
```python
async def generate_response(prompt, model='gemini-2.0-flash'):
    # Configure generation
    config = {
        'temperature': 0.8,
        'top_p': 0.95,
        'max_tokens': 2000,
        'stop_sequences': ['[END]']
    }

    # Generate with retry logic
    response = await gemini_client.generate(
        prompt,
        config,
        retry_count=3
    )

    return response
```

#### 4. Response Parsing
```python
def parse_response(ai_response):
    # Extract sections
    narrative = extract_narrative(ai_response)
    state_update = extract_state_update(ai_response)
    entities = extract_entities(ai_response)

    # Validate state update
    validated_state = validate_state_update(state_update)

    # Check narrative consistency
    consistency_check(narrative, validated_state, entities)

    return {
        'narrative': narrative,
        'state_update': validated_state,
        'entities': entities
    }
```

### Dual-Pass Generation

For critical operations, we use a two-pass generation approach:

#### Pass 1: Planning
```python
planning_prompt = """
Given the player action: {action}
Current state: {state}

Plan the following:
1. What should happen narratively?
2. What state changes are needed?
3. What dice rolls are required?
4. What entities are involved?
"""
```

#### Pass 2: Execution
```python
execution_prompt = """
Based on this plan: {plan}

Generate the full response with:
1. Engaging narrative
2. Precise state updates
3. Entity tracking
"""
```

### Error Handling

#### AI Response Validation

1. **Schema Validation**: Ensure response matches expected format
2. **State Validation**: Verify state changes are legal
3. **Consistency Check**: Confirm narrative matches state
4. **Entity Validation**: Check all entities are tracked
5. **Rules Validation**: Ensure D&D rules are followed

#### Fallback Strategies

```python
def handle_ai_failure(error_type, context):
    if error_type == 'TIMEOUT':
        return generate_simple_response(context)
    elif error_type == 'INVALID_FORMAT':
        return retry_with_stricter_prompt(context)
    elif error_type == 'STATE_CONFLICT':
        return resolve_conflict_conservatively(context)
    else:
        return {
            'narrative': "The mystic energies swirl chaotically...",
            'state_update': {},
            'error': True
        }
```

## Game Mechanics

### D&D 5e Implementation

WorldArchitect.AI implements a comprehensive subset of Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules, focusing on core mechanics that enable engaging solo play while maintaining system authenticity.

### Character System

#### Ability Scores
- **Standard Array**: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8
- **Point Buy**: 27 points to distribute
- **Rolling**: 4d6 drop lowest (optional)
- **Modifiers**: (Score - 10) / 2

#### Core Attributes
```python
class Character:
    def __init__(self):
        self.attributes = {
            'strength': 10,
            'dexterity': 10,
            'constitution': 10,
            'intelligence': 10,
            'wisdom': 10,
            'charisma': 10
        }
        self.level = 1
        self.hp = {'current': 10, 'max': 10}
        self.ac = 10
        self.proficiency_bonus = 2
        self.skills = {}
        self.saves = {}
```

#### Skill System
- **18 Skills**: Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Arcana, etc.
- **Proficiency**: Add proficiency bonus to checks
- **Expertise**: Double proficiency bonus (rogue/bard)
- **Passive Perception**: 10 + Wisdom (Perception)

### Combat Mechanics

#### Initiative and Turn Order
```python
def roll_initiative(combatants):
    initiative_order = []
    for combatant in combatants:
        roll = random.randint(1, 20) + combatant.dexterity_modifier
        initiative_order.append((combatant, roll))
    return sorted(initiative_order, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

#### Action Economy
- **Action**: Attack, cast spell, dash, dodge, help, hide, ready, search
- **Bonus Action**: Class-specific abilities, off-hand attack
- **Movement**: Speed in feet (typically 30)
- **Reaction**: Opportunity attacks, counterspell, etc.
- **Free Actions**: Speak, draw/sheathe weapon, interact with object

#### Attack Resolution
```python
def make_attack(attacker, target, weapon):
    # Roll to hit
    attack_roll = roll_d20() + attacker.attack_bonus(weapon)

    # Check critical hit/miss
    if attack_roll_base == 20:
        return critical_hit(attacker, weapon)
    elif attack_roll_base == 1:
        return critical_miss()

    # Compare to AC
    if attack_roll >= target.ac:
        damage = roll_damage(weapon) + attacker.damage_bonus(weapon)
        return {'hit': True, 'damage': damage}
    else:
        return {'hit': False, 'damage': 0}
```

#### Damage Types
- **Physical**: Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning
- **Elemental**: Fire, Cold, Lightning, Thunder, Acid, Poison
- **Exotic**: Necrotic, Radiant, Psychic, Force

#### Conditions
1. **Blinded**: Can't see, auto-fail sight checks, disadvantage on attacks
2. **Charmed**: Can't attack charmer, charmer has advantage on social checks
3. **Deafened**: Can't hear, auto-fail hearing checks
4. **Frightened**: Disadvantage while source of fear is visible
5. **Grappled**: Speed 0, can't benefit from speed bonuses
6. **Incapacitated**: Can't take actions or reactions
7. **Invisible**: Heavily obscured, advantage on attacks
8. **Paralyzed**: Incapacitated, auto-fail STR/DEX saves
9. **Petrified**: Transformed to stone, resistance to all damage
10. **Poisoned**: Disadvantage on attacks and ability checks
11. **Prone**: Disadvantage on attacks, melee attacks have advantage
12. **Restrained**: Speed 0, disadvantage on attacks and DEX saves
13. **Stunned**: Incapacitated, auto-fail STR/DEX saves
14. **Unconscious**: Incapacitated, prone, auto-fail STR/DEX saves

### Magic System

#### Spell Slots
```python
SPELL_SLOTS_BY_LEVEL = {
    1: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Level 1: 2 1st level slots
    2: [3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Level 2: 3 1st level slots
    3: [4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Level 3: 4 1st, 2 2nd
    # ... continues to level 20
}
```

#### Spell Components
- **Verbal (V)**: Must be able to speak
- **Somatic (S)**: Must have free hand
- **Material (M)**: Must have components or focus

#### Concentration
- Only one concentration spell at a time
- Constitution saves to maintain (DC 10 or half damage)
- Broken by: Casting another concentration spell, incapacitation, death

### Progression System

#### Experience Points
```python
XP_THRESHOLDS = {
    1: 0,
    2: 300,
    3: 900,
    4: 2700,
    5: 6500,
    6: 14000,
    7: 23000,
    8: 34000,
    9: 48000,
    10: 64000,
    # ... continues to level 20
}
```

#### Leveling Benefits
- **Hit Points**: Class hit die + Constitution modifier
- **Proficiency Bonus**: Increases at levels 5, 9, 13, 17
- **Ability Score Improvements**: Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 19
- **Class Features**: Varies by class

### Custom Mechanics

#### Destiny Attribute System
Alternative to D&D attributes for different game feel:
```python
DESTINY_ATTRIBUTES = {
    'vigor': 'Physical prowess and endurance',
    'finesse': 'Agility and precision',
    'intellect': 'Knowledge and reasoning',
    'resolve': 'Willpower and determination',
    'intuition': 'Awareness and instinct',
    'presence': 'Charisma and leadership'
}
```

#### Conversion Guide
- Strength → Vigor
- Dexterity → Finesse
- Constitution → Vigor/Resolve
- Intelligence → Intellect
- Wisdom → Intuition
- Charisma → Presence

### Difficulty Classes

```python
DIFFICULTY_CLASSES = {
    'very_easy': 5,
    'easy': 10,
    'medium': 15,
    'hard': 20,
    'very_hard': 25,
    'nearly_impossible': 30
}
```

### Advantage/Disadvantage

- **Advantage**: Roll twice, take higher
- **Disadvantage**: Roll twice, take lower
- **Multiple sources**: Don't stack, cancel out

### Rest Mechanics

#### Short Rest (1 hour)
- Spend Hit Dice to recover HP
- Recover some class abilities
- Maintain narrative momentum

#### Long Rest (8 hours)
- Recover all HP
- Recover half Hit Dice
- Regain all spell slots
- Reset most abilities

### Death and Recovery

#### Death Saving Throws
- At 0 HP, make death saves
- DC 10 Constitution save
- 3 successes = stable
- 3 failures = death
- Natural 20 = regain 1 HP
- Natural 1 = 2 failures

#### Stabilization
- Medicine check DC 10
- Healing spell/potion
- Becomes stable at 0 HP

### Loot and Rewards

#### Currency
- **Copper (cp)**: 1/100 gp
- **Silver (sp)**: 1/10 gp
- **Electrum (ep)**: 1/2 gp
- **Gold (gp)**: Base currency
- **Platinum (pp)**: 10 gp

#### Magic Item Rarity
1. **Common**: Utility items, minor effects
2. **Uncommon**: +1 weapons/armor, useful effects
3. **Rare**: +2 weapons/armor, powerful effects
4. **Very Rare**: +3 weapons/armor, game-changing effects
5. **Legendary**: Artifacts, unique abilities
6. **Artifact**: Campaign-defining items

## State Management

### Overview

State management is the cornerstone of WorldArchitect.AI's consistency, working to maintain synchronization between narrative events and game mechanics. Our advanced validation system represents significant progress in reducing desynchronization in AI-driven gaming.

### State Object Architecture

#### Core State Structure
```python
@dataclass
class GameState:
    turn_number: int
    current_scene: str
    player: PlayerState
    npcs: Dict[str, NPCState]
    world: WorldState
    quests: Dict[str, QuestState]
    combat: CombatState
    entities: EntityManifest
    metadata: StateMetadata
```

#### Player State
```python
@dataclass
class PlayerState:
    # Identity
    name: str
    race: str
    class_name: str
    background: str
    alignment: str

    # Attributes
    level: int
    experience: int
    hp: HealthPoints
    attributes: Dict[str, int]
    skills: Dict[str, SkillProficiency]

    # Resources
    spell_slots: Dict[int, SpellSlotInfo]
    abilities: List[Ability]
    inventory: List[Item]
    currency: Currency

    # Status
    conditions: List[Condition]
    inspiration: bool
    exhaustion: int
    death_saves: DeathSaves
```

#### NPC State
```python
@dataclass
class NPCState:
    # Identity
    name: str
    race: str
    role: str  # 'ally', 'enemy', 'neutral'

    # Stats
    hp: HealthPoints
    ac: int
    attributes: Dict[str, int]

    # Behavior
    attitude: str  # 'hostile', 'friendly', 'neutral'
    goals: List[str]
    knowledge: List[str]

    # Status
    location: str
    conditions: List[Condition]
    alive: bool
```

### State Update Pipeline

#### 1. AI Response Parsing
```python
def parse_state_update(ai_response: str) -> StateUpdate:
    # Extract state block
    state_match = re.search(r'\[STATE_UPDATE\](.*?)\[/STATE_UPDATE\]',
                           ai_response, re.DOTALL)

    if not state_match:
        return StateUpdate()

    # Parse JSON
    try:
        update_data = json.loads(state_match.group(1))
    except JSONDecodeError:
        return handle_malformed_update(state_match.group(1))

    # Validate against schema
    return validate_state_update(update_data)
```

#### 2. Validation Layer
```python
class StateValidator:
    def validate(self, update: StateUpdate, current: GameState) -> ValidationResult:
        errors = []

        # Type validation
        errors.extend(self.validate_types(update))

        # Range validation
        errors.extend(self.validate_ranges(update))

        # Logic validation
        errors.extend(self.validate_game_logic(update, current))

        # Consistency validation
        errors.extend(self.validate_consistency(update, current))

        return ValidationResult(
            valid=len(errors) == 0,
            errors=errors,
            sanitized_update=self.sanitize(update)
        )
```

#### 3. Merge Strategy
```python
def deep_merge_state(current: Dict, update: Dict) -> Dict:
    """
    Recursively merge update into current state.
    Handles nested dictionaries and special cases.
    """
    merged = current.copy()

    for key, value in update.items():
        if key not in merged:
            merged[key] = value
        elif isinstance(value, dict) and isinstance(merged[key], dict):
            # Recursive merge for nested dicts
            merged[key] = deep_merge_state(merged[key], value)
        elif isinstance(value, list):
            # Append for lists (configurable)
            if key in APPEND_ONLY_FIELDS:
                merged[key].extend(value)
            else:
                merged[key] = value
        else:
            # Direct replacement for primitives
            merged[key] = value

    return merged
```

### Combat State Management

#### Automatic Cleanup
```python
def cleanup_combat_state(state: GameState) -> GameState:
    """
    Automatically clean up combat when all enemies are defeated.
    """
    if not state.combat.active:
        return state

    # Check for living enemies
    living_enemies = [
        npc for npc in state.npcs.values()
        if npc.role == 'enemy' and npc.hp.current > 0
    ]

    if not living_enemies:
        # End combat
        state.combat.active = False
        state.combat.turn_order = []
        state.combat.current_turn = 0

        # Clean up defeated NPCs
        for npc_id, npc in list(state.npcs.items()):
            if npc.role == 'enemy' and npc.hp.current <= 0:
                del state.npcs[npc_id]

    return state
```

#### Turn Order Management
```python
class CombatManager:
    def update_turn_order(self, state: GameState) -> GameState:
        # Remove defeated combatants
        state.combat.turn_order = [
            combatant for combatant in state.combat.turn_order
            if self.is_active_combatant(combatant, state)
        ]

        # Advance turn
        if state.combat.turn_order:
            state.combat.current_turn = (
                (state.combat.current_turn + 1) %
                len(state.combat.turn_order)
            )

        return state
```

### Entity Tracking

#### Entity Manifest
```python
@dataclass
class EntityManifest:
    """Tracks all entities mentioned in the narrative"""

    characters: Dict[str, CharacterEntity]
    items: Dict[str, ItemEntity]
    locations: Dict[str, LocationEntity]

    def update_from_narrative(self, narrative: str, state: GameState):
        # Extract entities using NLP
        extracted = self.extract_entities(narrative)

        # Validate against state
        validated = self.validate_entities(extracted, state)

        # Update manifest
        self.merge_entities(validated)

        # Mark inactive entities
        self.update_activity_status(narrative)
```

#### Entity Lifecycle
```python
class EntityLifecycle:
    STATES = ['introduced', 'active', 'mentioned', 'inactive', 'departed']

    def transition(self, entity: Entity, event: str) -> Entity:
        transitions = {
            ('introduced', 'appears'): 'active',
            ('active', 'leaves'): 'departed',
            ('active', 'not_mentioned'): 'mentioned',
            ('mentioned', 'not_mentioned'): 'inactive',
            ('inactive', 'appears'): 'active'
        }

        new_state = transitions.get((entity.state, event))
        if new_state:
            entity.state = new_state
            entity.last_updated = datetime.now()

        return entity
```

### State Migrations

#### Version Management
```python
class StateMigrationManager:
    CURRENT_VERSION = "2.3.0"

    def migrate(self, state: Dict, version: str) -> Dict:
        """Migrate state from old version to current"""

        migrations = [
            ("1.0.0", "1.1.0", self.migrate_1_0_to_1_1),
            ("1.1.0", "1.2.0", self.migrate_1_1_to_1_2),
            ("1.2.0", "2.0.0", self.migrate_1_2_to_2_0),
            ("2.0.0", "2.1.0", self.migrate_2_0_to_2_1),
            ("2.1.0", "2.2.0", self.migrate_2_1_to_2_2),
            ("2.2.0", "2.3.0", self.migrate_2_2_to_2_3),
        ]

        current_version = version
        for old_ver, new_ver, migration_func in migrations:
            if current_version == old_ver:
                state = migration_func(state)
                current_version = new_ver

        state['version'] = self.CURRENT_VERSION
        return state
```

#### Migration Examples
```python
def migrate_2_2_to_2_3(self, state: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Add entity tracking to existing states"""

    if 'entities' not in state:
        state['entities'] = {
            'characters': {},
            'items': {},
            'locations': {}
        }

    # Extract entities from existing NPCs
    for npc_id, npc in state.get('npcs', {}).items():
        state['entities']['characters'][npc_id] = {
            'name': npc['name'],
            'type': 'npc',
            'state': 'active' if npc.get('hp', {}).get('current', 0) > 0 else 'inactive',
            'last_seen': state.get('turn_number', 0)
        }

    return state
```

### State Persistence

#### Firestore Integration
```python
class FirestoreStateManager:
    def save_state(self, campaign_id: str, state: GameState) -> bool:
        try:
            # Serialize state
            serialized = self.serialize_state(state)

            # Compress large states
            if len(json.dumps(serialized)) > 100000:
                serialized = self.compress_state(serialized)

            # Save to Firestore
            doc_ref = self.db.collection('campaigns').document(campaign_id)
            doc_ref.update({
                'current_state': serialized,
                'last_updated': firestore.SERVER_TIMESTAMP,
                'state_version': STATE_VERSION
            })

            # Archive previous state
            self.archive_state(campaign_id, state)

            return True

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Failed to save state: {e}")
            return False
```

#### State Compression
```python
def compress_state(self, state: Dict) -> Dict:
    """Compress state for storage efficiency"""

    compressed = state.copy()

    # Remove redundant data
    if 'npcs' in compressed:
        for npc in compressed['npcs'].values():
            # Remove default values
            if npc.get('conditions') == []:
                del npc['conditions']
            if npc.get('exhaustion') == 0:
                del npc['exhaustion']

    # Compress inventory
    if 'player' in compressed and 'inventory' in compressed['player']:
        compressed['player']['inventory'] = self.compress_inventory(
            compressed['player']['inventory']
        )

    return compressed
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Caching Strategy
```python
class StateCache:
    def __init__(self, ttl_seconds=300):
        self.cache = TTLCache(maxsize=100, ttl=ttl_seconds)
        self.locks = defaultdict(threading.Lock)

    def get_state(self, campaign_id: str) -> Optional[GameState]:
        with self.locks[campaign_id]:
            if campaign_id in self.cache:
                return deepcopy(self.cache[campaign_id])
            return None

    def set_state(self, campaign_id: str, state: GameState):
        with self.locks[campaign_id]:
            self.cache[campaign_id] = deepcopy(state)
```

#### Batch Operations
```python
def batch_update_states(self, updates: List[StateUpdate]) -> BatchResult:
    """Process multiple state updates efficiently"""

    results = []
    batch = self.db.batch()

    for update in updates:
        try:
            # Validate update
            validation = self.validate_update(update)
            if not validation.valid:
                results.append(BatchError(update.id, validation.errors))
                continue

            # Add to batch
            doc_ref = self.db.collection('campaigns').document(update.campaign_id)
            batch.update(doc_ref, update.changes)
            results.append(BatchSuccess(update.id))

        except Exception as e:
            results.append(BatchError(update.id, str(e)))

    # Commit batch
    batch.commit()
    return BatchResult(results)
```

#### Typography

```css
.narrative-text {
    font-family: var(--font-display, 'Crimson Text', serif);
    font-size: 1.125rem;
    line-height: 1.75;
    letter-spacing: 0.02em;
}

.ui-text {
    font-family: var(--font-ui, 'Inter', sans-serif);
    font-size: 0.875rem;
    font-weight: 500;
}

.game-stats {
    font-family: var(--font-mono, 'JetBrains Mono', monospace);
    font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums;
}
```

### Layout Architecture

#### Responsive Grid System
```html
<div class="app-container">
    <nav class="app-header">
        <!-- Logo, user menu, theme switcher -->
    </nav>

    <main class="app-content">
        <aside class="sidebar" data-state="collapsed">
            <!-- Campaign list, character sheet -->
        </aside>

        <section class="game-area">
            <div class="narrative-panel">
                <!-- Story display -->
            </div>

            <div class="input-area">
                <!-- Action input, mode toggle -->
            </div>
        </section>

        <aside class="info-panel">
            <!-- Game state, inventory -->
        </aside>
    </main>
</div>
```

#### Breakpoint Strategy
```css
/* Mobile First */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    /* Tablet layout */
    .sidebar { width: 280px; }
}

@media (min-width: 1024px) {
    /* Desktop layout */
    .sidebar { width: 320px; }
    .info-panel { display: block; }
}

@media (min-width: 1440px) {
    /* Wide screen optimization */
    .game-area { max-width: 900px; }
}
```

        const tooltip = document.createElement('div');
        tooltip.className = 'tooltip';
        tooltip.textContent = text;

        // Position calculation
        const rect = event.target.getBoundingClientRect();
        tooltip.style.top = `${rect.top - 40}px`;
        tooltip.style.left = `${rect.left + rect.width / 2}px`;

        document.body.appendChild(tooltip);
    }
}
```

### Accessibility

#### ARIA Implementation
```html
<!-- Screen reader announcements -->
<div class="sr-only" role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
    <span id="combat-status">Combat has begun with 3 goblins</span>
</div>

<!-- Interactive elements -->
<button
    class="btn-action"

        };
    }

    init() {
        document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
            const combo = this.getKeyCombo(e);
            if (this.shortcuts[combo]) {
                e.preventDefault();
                this.shortcuts[combo]();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

### Mobile Experience

#### Touch Optimization
```javascript
class TouchHandler {
    constructor() {
        this.swipeThreshold = 50;
        this.touchStart = null;
    }

    init() {
        const gameArea = document.querySelector('.game-area');

        gameArea.addEventListener('touchstart', (e) => {
            this.touchStart = {
                x: e.touches[0].clientX,
                y: e.touches[0].clientY
            };
        });

        gameArea.addEventListener('touchend', (e) => {
            if (!this.touchStart) return;

            const deltaX = e.changedTouches[0].clientX - this.touchStart.x;

            if (Math.abs(deltaX) > this.swipeThreshold) {
                if (deltaX > 0) {
                    this.showSidebar();
                } else {
                    this.hideSidebar();
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### Mobile-Specific UI
```css
@media (max-width: 767px) {
    /* Full-screen modals */
    .modal {
        position: fixed;
        inset: 0;
        margin: 0;
        max-height: 100vh;
    }

    /* Larger touch targets */
    .btn {
        min-height: 44px;
        min-width: 44px;
    }

    /* Simplified layout */
    .sidebar {
        position: fixed;
        transform: translateX(-100%);
        transition: transform 0.3s ease;
    }

    .sidebar.active {
        transform: translateX(0);
    }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Lazy Loading
```javascript
class LazyLoader {
    constructor() {
        this.observer = new IntersectionObserver(
            this.onIntersection.bind(this),
            { rootMargin: '50px' }
        );
    }

    observe(elements) {
        elements.forEach(el => this.observer.observe(el));
    }

    onIntersection(entries) {
        entries.forEach(entry => {
            if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                this.loadContent(entry.target);
                this.observer.unobserve(entry.target);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### Virtual Scrolling
```javascript
class VirtualScroller {
    constructor(container, items, itemHeight) {
        this.container = container;
        this.items = items;
        this.itemHeight = itemHeight;
        this.visibleRange = { start: 0, end: 0 };
    }

    render() {
        const scrollTop = this.container.scrollTop;
        const containerHeight = this.container.clientHeight;

        this.visibleRange = {
            start: Math.floor(scrollTop / this.itemHeight),
            end: Math.ceil((scrollTop + containerHeight) / this.itemHeight)
        };

        this.renderVisibleItems();
    }
}
```

## Security & Privacy

### Overview

WorldArchitect.AI implements defense-in-depth security principles to protect user data, ensure platform integrity, and maintain trust. Our security architecture addresses authentication, authorization, data protection, and privacy compliance.

### Authentication System

#### OAuth 2.0 Implementation
```python
class AuthenticationService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.oauth_providers = {
            'google': GoogleOAuthProvider(),
            'github': GitHubOAuthProvider(),  # Future
            'discord': DiscordOAuthProvider()  # Future
        }

    async def authenticate(self, provider, credentials):
        # Validate provider
        if provider not in self.oauth_providers:
            raise InvalidProviderError()

        # Verify OAuth token
        user_info = await self.oauth_providers[provider].verify(credentials)

        # Create or update user
        user = await self.create_or_update_user(user_info)

        # Generate session
        session = self.create_session(user)

        return session
```

#### Session Management
```python
class SessionManager:
    SESSION_DURATION = 86400  # 24 hours
    REFRESH_THRESHOLD = 3600  # 1 hour

    def create_session(self, user):
        session_id = secrets.token_urlsafe(32)
        session_data = {
            'user_id': user.id,
            'created_at': datetime.utcnow(),
            'last_activity': datetime.utcnow(),
            'ip_address': request.remote_addr,
            'user_agent': request.headers.get('User-Agent')
        }

        # Store in secure cache
        self.cache.set(
            f"session:{session_id}",
            session_data,
            ttl=self.SESSION_DURATION
        )

        return session_id
```

### Authorization Framework

#### Role-Based Access Control
```python
class RBAC:
    ROLES = {
        'user': ['read_own', 'write_own'],
        'premium': ['read_own', 'write_own', 'export_unlimited'],
        'admin': ['read_all', 'write_all', 'delete_all'],
        'moderator': ['read_all', 'flag_content']
    }

    def check_permission(self, user, resource, action):
        user_permissions = self.get_user_permissions(user)
        required_permission = f"{action}_{resource.scope}"

        if required_permission not in user_permissions:
            raise PermissionDeniedError()

        # Additional resource-level checks
        if resource.scope == 'own' and resource.owner_id != user.id:
            raise PermissionDeniedError()
```

#### API Key Management
```python
class APIKeyManager:
    def generate_api_key(self, user_id, scopes):
        # Generate secure key
        key = f"wai_{secrets.token_urlsafe(32)}"

        # Hash for storage
        key_hash = hashlib.sha256(key.encode()).hexdigest()

        # Store with metadata
        self.db.api_keys.insert({
            'key_hash': key_hash,
            'user_id': user_id,
            'scopes': scopes,
            'created_at': datetime.utcnow(),
            'last_used': None,
            'usage_count': 0
        })

        return key  # Return only once
```

### Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
```python
class DataEncryption:
    def __init__(self):
        self.kms_client = google.cloud.kms.KeyManagementServiceClient()
        self.key_name = self.get_encryption_key()

    def encrypt_sensitive_data(self, data):
        # Generate data encryption key (DEK)
        dek = Fernet.generate_key()

        # Encrypt data with DEK
        f = Fernet(dek)
        encrypted_data = f.encrypt(data.encode())

        # Encrypt DEK with KMS
        encrypted_dek = self.kms_client.encrypt(
            request={
                'name': self.key_name,
                'plaintext': dek
            }
        ).ciphertext

        return {
            'data': encrypted_data,
            'encrypted_key': encrypted_dek
        }
```

#### Encryption in Transit
- **TLS 1.3**: Minimum supported version
- **HSTS**: Strict Transport Security enabled
- **Certificate Pinning**: For mobile apps (future)
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Enabled

### Input Validation & Sanitization

#### Request Validation
```python
class RequestValidator:
    def validate_input(self, data, schema):
        # Schema validation
        try:
            validated = schema.load(data)
        except ValidationError as e:
            raise InvalidInputError(e.messages)

        # Additional security checks
        self.check_sql_injection(validated)
        self.check_xss(validated)
        self.check_command_injection(validated)

        return validated

    def sanitize_output(self, content):
        # HTML escaping
        content = html.escape(content)

        # Markdown sanitization
        allowed_tags = ['p', 'br', 'strong', 'em', 'code', 'pre']
        content = bleach.clean(content, tags=allowed_tags)

        return content
```

#### File Upload Security
```python
class FileUploadHandler:
    ALLOWED_TYPES = ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'text/plain']
    MAX_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB

    def validate_upload(self, file):
        # Check file size
        if file.size > self.MAX_SIZE:
            raise FileTooLargeError()

        # Verify MIME type
        mime = magic.from_buffer(file.read(1024), mime=True)
        if mime not in self.ALLOWED_TYPES:
            raise InvalidFileTypeError()

        # Scan for malware
        if self.virus_scanner.scan(file):
            raise MalwareDetectedError()

        # Generate safe filename
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        return filename
```

### Privacy Protection

#### Data Minimization
```python
class PrivacyManager:
    def collect_analytics(self, event):
        # Only collect necessary data
        anonymized_event = {
            'event_type': event.type,
            'timestamp': event.timestamp,
            'session_hash': self.hash_session_id(event.session_id),
            # No PII collected
        }

        return anonymized_event

    def anonymize_user_data(self, user_data):
        # Remove or hash PII
        return {
            'id': user_data['id'],
            'created_date': user_data['created_at'].date(),
            'campaign_count': len(user_data['campaigns']),
            # Email, name, etc. excluded
        }
```

#### GDPR Compliance
```python
class GDPRCompliance:
    def export_user_data(self, user_id):
        """Right to data portability"""
        data = {
            'profile': self.get_user_profile(user_id),
            'campaigns': self.get_user_campaigns(user_id),
            'activity': self.get_user_activity(user_id)
        }

        return json.dumps(data, indent=2)

    def delete_user_data(self, user_id):
        """Right to erasure"""
        # Soft delete with retention period
        self.db.users.update(
            {'id': user_id},
            {
                '$set': {
                    'deleted_at': datetime.utcnow(),
                    'deletion_scheduled': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(days=30)
                }
            }
        )

        # Schedule hard delete
        self.scheduler.schedule_deletion(user_id, days=30)
```

### Security Monitoring

#### Intrusion Detection
```python
class SecurityMonitor:
    def detect_anomalies(self, request):
        # Rate limiting check
        if self.is_rate_limited(request.ip):
            self.block_ip(request.ip)
            return False

        # Suspicious pattern detection
        patterns = [
            r'<script',  # XSS attempts
            r'union\s+select',  # SQL injection
            r'\.\./',  # Path traversal
            r'eval\(',  # Code injection
        ]

        for pattern in patterns:
            if re.search(pattern, str(request.data), re.I):
                self.log_security_event(request, pattern)
                return False

        return True
```

#### Audit Logging
```python
class AuditLogger:
    def log_event(self, event_type, user, details):
        audit_entry = {
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow(),
            'event_type': event_type,
            'user_id': user.id if user else None,
            'ip_address': request.remote_addr,
            'user_agent': request.headers.get('User-Agent'),
            'details': details,
            'request_id': request.id
        }

        # Write to secure audit log
        self.audit_db.insert(audit_entry)

        # Alert on critical events
        if event_type in self.CRITICAL_EVENTS:
            self.alert_security_team(audit_entry)
```

### API Security

#### Rate Limiting
```python
class RateLimiter:
    LIMITS = {
        'api_call': (100, 60),  # 100 calls per minute
        'auth_attempt': (5, 300),  # 5 attempts per 5 minutes
        'export': (10, 3600),  # 10 exports per hour
    }

    def check_limit(self, key, action):
        limit, window = self.LIMITS[action]
        current = self.redis.incr(f"{action}:{key}")

        if current == 1:
            self.redis.expire(f"{action}:{key}", window)

        if current > limit:
            raise RateLimitExceededError()
```

#### CORS Configuration
```python
CORS_CONFIG = {
    'origins': [
        'https://worldarchitect.ai',
        'https://app.worldarchitect.ai'
    ],
    'methods': ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
    'allowed_headers': ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
    'exposed_headers': ['X-Request-ID'],
    'credentials': True,
    'max_age': 86400
}
```

| Database Query | 20ms | 50ms | 100ms | 500ms |
| Static Asset | 50ms | 150ms | 300ms | 1s |

#### AI Response Optimization
```python
class ResponseOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = ResponseCache()
        self.predictor = ResponsePredictor()

    async def optimize_response(self, request):
        # Check cache first
        cached = self.cache.get(request.hash())
        if cached and cached.age < 300:  # 5 minute cache
            return cached.response

        # Predictive pre-generation
        if self.predictor.should_pregenerate(request):
            asyncio.create_task(self.pregenerate_likely_responses(request))

        # Parallel processing
        tasks = [
            self.generate_narrative(request),
            self.calculate_state_changes(request),
            self.validate_entities(request)
        ]

        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return self.combine_results(results)
```

### Scalability Requirements

#### Concurrent Users
- **Target**: 10,000 concurrent users
- **Peak**: 50,000 concurrent users
- **Sessions**: 100,000 daily active users

#### Load Distribution
```python
class LoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.servers = self.discover_servers()
        self.health_checker = HealthChecker()

    def route_request(self, request):
        # Check server health
        healthy_servers = [
            s for s in self.servers
            if self.health_checker.is_healthy(s)
        ]

        # Route based on load
        if request.is_ai_heavy:
            server = self.get_least_loaded_ai_server(healthy_servers)
        else:
            server = self.get_nearest_server(request.location)

        return server
```

### Database Performance

#### Query Optimization
```python
class QueryOptimizer:
    def optimize_campaign_query(self, user_id):
        # Use composite index
        return self.db.campaigns.find({
            'user_id': user_id,
            'deleted': {'$ne': True}
        }).hint('user_id_1_updated_at_-1').limit(50)

    def optimize_story_query(self, campaign_id, limit=10):
        # Projection to reduce data transfer
        return self.db.stories.find(
            {'campaign_id': campaign_id},
            {
                'narrative': 1,
                'turn_number': 1,
                'timestamp': 1,
                'game_state.player.hp': 1
            }
        ).sort('turn_number', -1).limit(limit)
```

#### Indexing Strategy
```javascript
// Firestore composite indexes
{
  "indexes": [
    {
      "collectionGroup": "campaigns",
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "user_id", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "updated_at", "order": "DESCENDING"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "collectionGroup": "stories",
      "fields": [
        {"fieldPath": "campaign_id", "order": "ASCENDING"},
        {"fieldPath": "turn_number", "order": "DESCENDING"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Caching Strategy

#### Multi-Layer Cache
```python
class CacheSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.l1_cache = InMemoryCache(max_size=1000)  # Hot data
        self.l2_cache = RedisCache()  # Distributed cache
        self.l3_cache = CDNCache()  # Static assets

    async def get(self, key):
        # Check L1
        value = self.l1_cache.get(key)
        if value:
            return value

        # Check L2
        value = await self.l2_cache.get(key)
        if value:
            self.l1_cache.set(key, value)
            return value

        # Check L3
        value = await self.l3_cache.get(key)
        if value:
            await self.l2_cache.set(key, value)
            self.l1_cache.set(key, value)
            return value

        return None
```

#### Cache Invalidation
```python
class CacheInvalidator:
    def invalidate_campaign(self, campaign_id):
        patterns = [
            f"campaign:{campaign_id}:*",
            f"stories:{campaign_id}:*",
            f"state:{campaign_id}:*"
        ]

        for pattern in patterns:
            self.redis.delete_pattern(pattern)

        # Publish invalidation event
        self.pubsub.publish('cache_invalidation', {
            'type': 'campaign',
            'id': campaign_id
        })
```

### Resource Optimization

#### Memory Management
```python
class MemoryManager:
    MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE = 100000  # tokens
    MAX_STATE_SIZE = 1048576  # 1MB

    def optimize_context(self, stories):
        total_size = sum(len(s.narrative) for s in stories)

        if total_size > self.MAX_CONTEXT_SIZE:
            # Summarize older stories
            cutoff = len(stories) // 3
            summarized = self.summarize_stories(stories[:cutoff])
            recent = stories[cutoff:]
            return summarized + recent

        return stories

    def compress_state(self, state):
        if sys.getsizeof(state) > self.MAX_STATE_SIZE:
            # Remove transient data
            compressed = self.remove_defaults(state)
            # Archive old quest data
            compressed = self.archive_completed_quests(compressed)
            return compressed

        return state
```

#### Connection Pooling
```python
class ConnectionPool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.pools = {
            'firestore': FirestorePool(min_size=10, max_size=100),
            'redis': RedisPool(min_size=5, max_size=50),
            'gemini': GeminiPool(min_size=20, max_size=200)
        }

    async def get_connection(self, service):
        pool = self.pools[service]

        # Try to get existing connection
        conn = await pool.acquire(timeout=1.0)

        # Create new if needed and under limit
        if not conn and pool.size < pool.max_size:
            conn = await pool.create_connection()

        return conn
```

### Frontend Performance

#### Bundle Optimization
```javascript
// Webpack configuration
module.exports = {
    optimization: {
        splitChunks: {
            chunks: 'all',
            cacheGroups: {
                vendor: {
                    test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]/,
                    name: 'vendor',
                    priority: 10
                },
                common: {
                    minChunks: 2,
                    priority: 5,
                    reuseExistingChunk: true
                }
            }
        },
        minimizer: [
            new TerserPlugin({
                parallel: true,
                terserOptions: {
                    compress: {
                        drop_console: true
                    }
                }
            })
        ]
    }
};
```

#### Lazy Loading
```javascript
class ComponentLoader {
    async loadGameView() {
        const module = await import(
            /* webpackChunkName: "game" */
            './views/GameView.js'
        );
        return module.default;
    }

    async loadCampaignManager() {
        const module = await import(
            /* webpackChunkName: "campaigns" */
            './views/CampaignManager.js'
        );
        return module.default;
    }
}
```

### Monitoring & Metrics

#### Performance Tracking
```python
class PerformanceMonitor:
    def track_request(self, request_id):
        return RequestTracker(request_id)

class RequestTracker:
    def __init__(self, request_id):
        self.request_id = request_id
        self.start_time = time.time()
        self.checkpoints = []

    def checkpoint(self, name):
        self.checkpoints.append({
            'name': name,
            'time': time.time() - self.start_time
        })

    def complete(self):
        total_time = time.time() - self.start_time

        # Log to monitoring service
        metrics.record({
            'request_id': self.request_id,
            'total_time': total_time,
            'checkpoints': self.checkpoints
        })

        # Alert if slow
        if total_time > 5.0:
            alerts.trigger('slow_request', self.request_id)
```

#### Real-time Dashboards
```python
MONITORING_METRICS = {
    'response_time': {
        'type': 'histogram',
        'buckets': [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0]
    },
    'concurrent_users': {
        'type': 'gauge',
        'alert_threshold': 8000
    },
    'error_rate': {
        'type': 'counter',
        'window': '5m',
        'alert_threshold': 0.01  # 1%
    },
    'ai_tokens_used': {
        'type': 'counter',
        'labels': ['model', 'operation']
    }
}
```

### Load Testing

#### Test Scenarios
```python
class LoadTestScenarios:
    @scenario(users=1000, duration='10m')
    def typical_gameplay(self):
        # Simulate typical user behavior
        self.login()
        self.view_campaigns()
        self.continue_story()
        self.wait(think_time=5)
        self.continue_story()
        self.view_state()

    @scenario(users=5000, duration='5m')
    def campaign_creation_spike(self):
        # Simulate marketing campaign
        self.register()
        self.create_campaign()
        self.play_tutorial()

    @scenario(users=100, duration='1h')
    def extended_session(self):
        # Long gameplay session
        self.login()
        for _ in range(50):
            self.continue_story()
            self.wait(think_time=10)
```

        self.service.client = self.mock_client

    def test_continue_story_success(self):
        # Arrange
        mock_response = Mock()
        mock_response.text = "[NARRATIVE]\nYou enter the tavern...\n[STATE_UPDATE]\n{}"
        self.mock_client.generate_content.return_value = mock_response

        # Act
        result = self.service.continue_story("I enter the tavern", {}, [])

        # Assert
        self.assertIn("You enter the tavern", result['narrative'])
        self.assertEqual(result['state_update'], {})

    def test_entity_extraction(self):
        # Test entity tracking
        narrative = "The bartender John greets you warmly."
        entities = self.service.extract_entities(narrative)

        self.assertEqual(entities['npcs']['john']['name'], 'John')
        self.assertEqual(entities['npcs']['john']['role'], 'bartender')
```

#### Frontend Unit Tests
```javascript
describe('StateManager', () => {
    let stateManager;

    beforeEach(() => {
        stateManager = new StateManager();
    });

    test('should merge state updates correctly', () => {
        const initial = {
            player: { hp: { current: 20, max: 20 } }
        };

        const update = {
            player: { hp: { current: 15 } }
        };

        const result = stateManager.mergeState(initial, update);

        expect(result.player.hp.current).toBe(15);
        expect(result.player.hp.max).toBe(20);
    });

    test('should handle combat cleanup', () => {
        const state = {
            combat: { active: true },
            npcs: {
                'goblin1': { hp: { current: 0 }, role: 'enemy' }
            }
        };

        const cleaned = stateManager.cleanupCombat(state);

        expect(cleaned.combat.active).toBe(false);
        expect(cleaned.npcs).toEqual({});
    });
});
```

### Integration Testing

#### API Integration Tests
```python
class TestCampaignAPI(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = TestClient(app)
        self.auth_token = self.get_test_auth_token()

    def test_create_campaign_flow(self):
        # Create campaign
        response = self.client.post('/api/campaigns',
            headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.auth_token}'},
            json={
                'title': 'Test Campaign',
                'prompt': 'Start in a tavern',
                'aiPersona': 'narrative_flair'
            }
        )

        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 201)
        campaign_id = response.json()['campaignId']

        # Continue story
        response = self.client.post(f'/api/campaigns/{campaign_id}/continue',
            headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.auth_token}'},
            json={'action': 'Look around the tavern'}
        )

        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertIn('narrative', response.json())
```

#### Service Integration Tests
```python
class TestServiceIntegration(TestCase):
    @patch('services.firestore_service.db')
    @patch('services.llm_service.client')
    def test_full_story_flow(self, mock_llm, mock_firestore):
        # Setup mocks
        mock_llm.generate_content.return_value.text = self.get_mock_ai_response()
        mock_firestore.collection.return_value.document.return_value.get.return_value.exists = True

        # Execute flow
        campaign_service = CampaignService()
        result = campaign_service.continue_story('campaign123', 'user123', 'Test action')

        # Verify interactions
        mock_firestore.collection.assert_called_with('campaigns')
        mock_llm.generate_content.assert_called_once()
        self.assertIsNotNone(result['narrative'])
```

### End-to-End Testing

#### Critical User Journeys
```javascript
describe('New User Journey', () => {
    beforeEach(async () => {
        await page.goto('https://localhost:3000');
    });

    test('should complete onboarding flow', async () => {
        // Login
        await page.click('[data-test="login-button"]');
        await page.waitForNavigation();

        // Create first campaign
        await page.click('[data-test="create-campaign"]');
        await page.type('[data-test="campaign-title"]', 'My First Adventure');
        await page.type('[data-test="campaign-prompt"]', 'I am a wizard');
        await page.click('[data-test="start-campaign"]');

        // Verify game started
        await page.waitForSelector('[data-test="narrative-text"]');
        const narrative = await page.$eval('[data-test="narrative-text"]', el => el.textContent);
        expect(narrative).toContain('wizard');
    });
});
```

#### Accessibility Testing
```javascript
describe('Accessibility', () => {
    test('should be navigable by keyboard', async () => {
        await page.goto('https://localhost:3000/game');

        // Tab through interface
        await page.keyboard.press('Tab');
        const focusedElement = await page.evaluate(() => document.activeElement.dataset.test);
        expect(focusedElement).toBe('action-input');

        // Submit with Enter
        await page.type('[data-test="action-input"]', 'Test action');
        await page.keyboard.press('Enter');

        // Verify submission
        await page.waitForSelector('[data-test="loading-indicator"]');
    });

    test('should meet WCAG standards', async () => {
        const results = await axe(page);
        expect(results.violations).toHaveLength(0);
    });

### AI Quality Testing

#### Narrative Consistency Tests
```python
class TestNarrativeConsistency(TestCase):
    def test_entity_persistence(self):
        # Introduce NPC
        response1 = self.ai_service.generate("I talk to the shopkeeper")
        self.assertIn("shopkeeper", response1['entities']['npcs'])

        # Reference NPC later
        response2 = self.ai_service.generate("What did the shopkeeper say?")
        self.assertIn("shopkeeper", response2['narrative'])

        # Verify consistency
        self.assertEqual(
            response1['entities']['npcs']['shopkeeper']['name'],
            response2['entities']['npcs']['shopkeeper']['name']
        )
```

    def test_combat_rules(self):
        state = {
            'player': {'hp': {'current': 10, 'max': 20}, 'ac': 15},
            'npcs': {
                'goblin': {'hp': {'current': 7}, 'ac': 13}
            }
        }

        # Test attack resolution
        response = self.ai_service.generate("I attack the goblin", state)

        # Verify dice rolls occurred
        self.assertRegex(response['narrative'], r'rolls? \d+')

        # Verify HP changes are valid
        if 'goblin' in response['state_update'].get('npcs', {}):
            new_hp = response['state_update']['npcs']['goblin']['hp']['current']
            self.assertLessEqual(new_hp, 7)
            self.assertGreaterEqual(new_hp, 0)

        response = self.client.post("/api/auth/login", json={
            "token": self.get_test_token()
        })
        self.token = response.json()['token']
        self.headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {self.token}'}

        # Get campaigns
        response = self.client.get("/api/campaigns", headers=self.headers)
        self.campaigns = response.json()['campaigns']

    @task(3)
    def continue_story(self):
        if self.campaigns:
            campaign = random.choice(self.campaigns)
            self.client.post(
                f"/api/campaigns/{campaign['id']}/continue",

            self.client.get(
                f"/api/campaigns/{campaign['id']}/state",
                headers=self.headers
            )
```

#### Stress Testing
```python
class StressTests(TestCase):
    def test_concurrent_state_updates(self):
        # Simulate race conditions
        campaign_id = self.create_test_campaign()

        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
            futures = []
            for i in range(10):
                future = executor.submit(
                    self.update_campaign_state,
                    campaign_id,
                    f"Action {i}"
                )
                futures.append(future)

            results = [f.result() for f in futures]

        # Verify no conflicts
        final_state = self.get_campaign_state(campaign_id)
        self.assertEqual(final_state['turn_number'], 10)
```
