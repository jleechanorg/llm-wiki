# PR: Behavioral Compliance MVP - Header Automation Using Memory MCP

## Summary
Replace the over-engineered cognitive enhancement system with a focused MVP that addresses the #1 compliance failure: missing headers. Uses Memory MCP for behavioral learning instead of static documentation.

## Problem Statement
- User consistently has to type `/header` command (system failure indicator)
- CLAUDE.md header protocol has ~80% violation rate despite explicit 2500-line documentation
- Static rules don't create behavioral change - need dynamic enforcement

## Solution: Behavioral Automation Engine
Focus on **single behavior** (headers) to prove concept before expanding to other compliance areas.

### Core Components:
1. **Header Detection**: Regex check for `[Local: branch | Remote: upstream | PR: number url]` format
2. **Auto-Correction**: Use existing `git-header.sh` script to insert missing headers
3. **Memory MCP Learning**: Store violation patterns and contexts for behavioral improvement
4. **Success Measurement**: Track user `/header` command frequency reduction

## Files Added

### Planning Documents
- `roadmap/scratchpad_memory_mvp.md` - MVP implementation plan
- `roadmap/detailed_roadmap_behavioral_automation.md` - Long-term roadmap for complete CLAUDE.md replacement

### Implementation Roadmap
**Week 1**: Core compliance engine + Memory MCP integration
**Week 2**: Claude Code pipeline integration
**Week 3**: User validation and success measurement

## Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Reduce user `/header` commands by 90% (from ~10/day to <1/day)
- **Secondary**: Header compliance rate >95%
- **Technical**: Auto-correction accuracy >99%, <100ms processing overhead
- **Qualitative**: User says "I haven't typed `/header` in days"

## Architecture Benefits vs Original PR #591

| Original PR #591 | This MVP |
|------------------|----------|
| ❌ 10+ components, complex | ✅ 3 components, simple |
| ❌ Arbitrary confidence math | ✅ Measurable success metrics |
| ❌ Static documentation generation | ✅ Dynamic Memory MCP learning |
| ❌ Testing theater (claims vs reality) | ✅ Real behavioral measurement |
| ❌ Tries to solve everything | ✅ Focused on proven concept |

## Why This Approach Works
1. **Addresses Real Pain**: User's biggest compliance frustration
2. **Measurable Success**: Clear before/after metrics
3. **Simple Technology**: Regex + existing scripts + Memory MCP
4. **Expandable Foundation**: Proven concept scales to other behaviors
5. **Low Risk**: Conservative implementation with high ROI

## Future Expansion Path
Once header compliance achieves 90% success:
- **Phase 2**: Test execution claims (stop false "tests complete")
- **Phase 3**: Evidence-based debugging (show errors before fixes)
- **Phase 4**: Response length optimization (context-aware verbosity)
- **Phase 5**: Complete CLAUDE.md replacement with dynamic system

## Implementation Notes
- Uses existing `claude_command_scripts/git-header.sh` for header generation
- Memory MCP integration for persistent behavioral learning
- Graceful fallback if Memory MCP unavailable
- Conservative compliance checking to avoid false positives

## Expected Impact
- **Immediate**: Eliminate daily user frustration with headers
- **Proof of Concept**: Validate behavioral automation approach
- **Foundation**: Enable systematic replacement of static CLAUDE.md
- **Innovation**: Novel approach to AI behavioral compliance

This MVP proves that behavioral automation beats static documentation for rule compliance. Success here justifies investment in complete CLAUDE.md transformation.
