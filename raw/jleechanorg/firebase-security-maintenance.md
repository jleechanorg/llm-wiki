# Firebase Security Rules - Maintenance Guide

## 🔒 Security Status
**Status**: ✅ **SECURE** - Production rules deployed
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-14
**Project**: worldarchitecture-ai

## 📋 Quick Health Check

Run this command to verify security status:
```bash
./scripts/validate-security.sh
```

## 🚨 Monitoring & Alerts

### What to Monitor
1. **Firebase Console > Firestore > Rules**
   - Check for rule violations in logs
   - Monitor denied requests (should be attackers, not real users)

2. **Firebase Console > Authentication**
   - Watch for unusual login patterns
   - Monitor user registration activity

### Red Flags 🚩
- Sudden spike in denied requests (potential attack)
- Users reporting access issues (rule too strict?)
- Authentication failures increasing

## 🔧 Common Maintenance Tasks

### Update Rules
1. Edit `deployment/firebase/firestore.rules`
2. Test with: `firebase emulators:start --only firestore`
3. Deploy with: `./scripts/deploy-firestore-rules.sh`

### Add New Data Collection
1. Add rules in `deployment/firebase/firestore.rules` for new collection
2. Follow pattern: authenticate → validate ownership → validate data
3. Test thoroughly before deploying

### Emergency Rule Rollback
```bash
# If rules break app functionality
git checkout HEAD~1 deployment/firebase/firestore.rules
./scripts/deploy-firestore-rules.sh
```

## 🛡️ Security Principles Applied

### Defense in Depth
- ✅ Authentication required
- ✅ Ownership validation
- ✅ Input validation
- ✅ Default deny-all

### Zero Trust Model
- No implicit trust
- Every request validated
- Principle of least privilege

## 🧪 Testing Security Rules

### Local Testing
```bash
npm install -g @firebase/rules-unit-testing
firebase emulators:start --only firestore
# Run tests against emulator
```

### Production Verification
```bash
./scripts/validate-security.sh
```

## 📚 Rule Documentation

### Core Functions
- `isAuthenticated()` - Requires valid Firebase Auth token
- `isOwner(userId)` - Validates user owns the resource
- `isValidCampaignData()` - Validates campaign creation data
- `isValidStateUpdate()` - Validates game state updates

### Protected Collections
- `/campaigns/{id}` - User ownership required
- `/users/{id}` - Self-access only
- `/user_settings/{id}` - Self-access only
- `/game_states/{id}` - Owner access only

## 🆘 Emergency Contacts

### If Security Issues Arise
1. Check Firebase Console error logs
2. Test with `./scripts/validate-security.sh`
3. Review recent rule changes in git history
4. Contact Firebase Support if needed

### Critical Security Incident Response
1. **IMMEDIATELY**: Disable affected rules or revert
2. **ANALYZE**: Check logs for breach scope
3. **NOTIFY**: Inform users if data compromised
4. **PATCH**: Fix vulnerability and redeploy
5. **MONITOR**: Watch for continued attacks

**Remember**: Security rules are your last line of defense. Always err on the side of being too restrictive rather than too permissive.
